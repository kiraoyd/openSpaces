NARRATOR: That first door is the easy door but there is a second door here NARRATOR: that is alarm activated as you can see the sign right there. Warning Alarm is activated NARRATOR: So I\"ve got to put in my key right here. Not everyone gets this key really only the scientists here NARRATOR: We don't want just anybody having access to this room, because our fossils are very delicate and super important for research NARRATOR: so we don't want just anybody coming in here you know NARRATOR:but first, for the tour, I would like to introduce you to our very own paleontologist his name is Dr. Herb Meyer NARRATOR: hi Dr. eErb Meyer how are you doing? DR. MEYER: Hey Ricardo, I'm doing well today. NARRATOR: Awesome. NARRATOR: I'm coming in today giving a tour to the folks out in the theater and was gonna see if you can take a few minutes out of your day to give us a behind the scenes look here. DR. MEYER: Sure we can do that. So I've been the paleontologist here for about 23 years and some of those years we've made excavations of the fossils so I can take you in and show you where we keep those DR. MEYER: We also done research on them publish scientific papers, books, DR. MEYER: we also go out into the field every year to look at the fossil sites to see how they are changing, So we have a lot of different things that are going on DR. MEYER: We have a staff of seven people back here in the paleontology division this year, so let's go on back and I'll show you the collections NARRATOR: Great sounds exciting NARRATOR: and as you will see Herb is going to punch in a code to get into the collection roodm another top secret spot in the lab DR. MEYER: So this is where the fossils are kept, we have about 12,000 fossils back here and they are kept in these cabinets you see through the room back here DR. MEYER: and this is one of our paleontology interns this summer and this is Erikka NARRATOR: hi Erikka DR. MEYER: she is taking photographs of some of the fossils we have DR. MEYER: and so they are in these cabinets, the cabinets are full of drawers and the drawers are full of fossils DR. MEYER: you can see some examples in here really quickly, this is the thorn of a rose NARRATOR: Wow very cool DR. MEYER: and this is the leaf of a rose a lot of times we have different parts of the plant that are preserved as fossils here DR. MEYER: this is foliage of Sequoia so this would be the foliage that goes with the large petrified redwood stumps that you see outside DR. MEYER: and then over here we have a cabinet that has the highest security so this is a fire cabinet that would survive a fire for about two hours up to about 2,000 degrees DR. MEYER: and in here are are some of the most impressive, most important of the fossils we have DR. MEYER: so here's an example, this is a flower of Florisantia so it's extinct and its named of course for florissant DR. MEYER: there are a number of insects, this is a katydid, so it's related to grasshoppers, it would be like a giant grasshopper DR. MEYER:this is the famous fossil wasp, NARRATOR: Is this the guy we see at the entrance? DR. MEYER: oh, you see it all over the place around here, the entrance on the signs. so it's a relative of the yellow jackets today. NARRATOR: nice DR. MEYER: and then we also have a few vertebrate fossil and one casmple of those is this bird Dr. MEYER: this was found by an elementary school student, it actually comes from a privaetly own site, so that's why they were able to collect it then it was donated to us DR. MEYER: but it's a bird, you can see the feathers extending out from the wing here, and the head the head's broken but this is the head over here and the neck Dr. MEYER: so those are a few examples of the kinds of things we have back in here NARRATOR: awesome, well thank you so much for taking the time out of your day Dr. Meyer really appreciate it, you bet NARRATOR: Okay guys, now we are going to move on into the main room of the paleo lab and I'm gonna introduce you to a couple of the post docs here you can see their library here, they refer to books every now and then NARRATOR:and here we have Dr. Evan Anderson how are you doing today Dr. Anderson DR. ANDERSON: I\"m doing pretty well Ricardo NARRATOR: Right on, I was gonna ask if you could share a little bit about what you do here at the Monument to the folks in the theater DR. ANDERSON: Sure, that's not a problem at all, I\"m here in the prepartion room right now as you saw back there we have quite a few specimens and occasionally we need to prepare them DR. ANDERSON: or extract a little bit more of the fossils that are presesrved or maybe stabilize them and this is where we keep all of our equipment for that DR. ANDERSON: here's all of our stabilization materials and down here we have our extraction materials mostly very fine needles and synthetic and also porcupine needles have proven to be very useful DR. ANDERSON: for extracting the very fine papershale that the florissant insects and plant are preserved in NARRATOR: that's incredible , neat DR. ANDERSON: and so as we prepare there's usually a litte bit of dust and shale fragments that are kicked up so we recently had a new vacuuming system installed to keep that out of our faces and out of our lungs DR. ANDERSON: we haven't used it yet but are looking forward to the opportunity now as you'll notice there's not anywhere to prepare anything here, there's normally a microscope here NARRATOR: yes it looks quite empty, where is the microscope DR. ANDERSON: so we had that moved next to my little lab space to help with some of the other projects I'm working on which mostly involves the fossil insects which are quite small and you really can't appreciate all the detail they have just by looking at them with the naked eye NARRATOR: can you show us a little bit of that DR. ANDERSON: sure sure be happy to DR. ANDERSON: so over here we have the micrsocope and my work station this summer one of the projects I'm working on is a quality assessment project that I satrted with another research over in California in the Los Angeles area DR. ANDERSON: what I'm doing is comparing the quality of the scores of the march flies that we have here at the Florissant formation giving them quality scores based on their various body parts like wings and legs and that sort of thing DR. ANDERSON: and then we'll compare it to the march flies in different formations NARRATOR: is that what we have here a march fly? DR. ANDERSON: yes,yes, they are pretty common at Florissant actually this is one of the better one's we have NARRATOR: wow, that's real neat stuff DR. ANDERSON: yeah, yeah, it's like I said you can't quite appreciate all of the details so just by looking at it so we have a microscope here to help out and we also have a monitor to show other people and to help take pictures with NARRATOR: is this the same guy under the microscope? DR. ANDERSON: yes, this is the exact same thing. NARRATOR: that is incredible DR. ANDERSON: this is 20 times magnification DR. ANDERSON: and you can see most of the wing veins are essentially complete here that would receive a high score DR. ANDERSON: the abdomen has lots of little tiny hairs on it so that would receive a high score too and the legs have quite a bit of detail as well NARRATOR: wow that is awesome very cool DR. ANDERSON: yeah, so I've been going through and we have over 100 of them and then I've just been compiling all the scores and then we'll get some statistical test going on later in the summer and fall DR. ANDERSON: but I have been looking at more than just the march flies I've been looking at all the different insect orders and we're trying to get our internal collections database online for the public to be able to see and Dr. Allen will tell you a little more about that. NARRATOR: HI Dr. Sarah Allen how are you? DR. ALLEN: Good how are you Ricardo NARRATOR: Great, I was going to see if you could take a few minutes out of your day and tell us what you do here at the Monument DR. ALLEN: Sure I'd be happy to, so as Dr. Anderson said we have an internal database here at the Monument with all of our specimens we can use it to locate our specimens in our collection it also has photographs it has the name of the specimen that it's been identified too DR. ALLEN: it has information about the locality and who identified it, it's really useful and we're using that internal databse to select specimens DR. ALLEN: Dr. Anderson is working on the insects I'm working on the plants and writing descriptions to put on that museum.nps.gov website DR. ALLEN: so this is an ongoing project within the Park Service including working with Florissant, DR. ALLEN: and here is the homepage of that website, I would encourage everyone to go visit it's museum.nps.gov and once you are on the home page you can navigate too where it says parks on the top menu DR. ALLEN: and it lists all the parks that currently have content on the website DR. ALLEN: you can select a park that looks interesting to you for example here is Dinosaur National Monument DR. ALLEN: and if you navigate to the lower right it says browse their collection and for example being that this is Dinosaur it has a bunch of the specimens that are behind the scenes at Dinosuar National Monument DR. ALLEN: so just like you saw the specimens behind the scenes with Dr. Meyer here are some specimens at Dinosaur DR. ALLEN: and you can click on one of those specimens and get more information so it has a bunch of photos it has a description so we are doing this with Florissant specimens DR. ALLEN: So this is one of the many projects I'm working on, I'm also creating a geologic time trail side exhibit DR. ALLEN: and a common fossil plant guide that you did this afternoon, saw this afternoon at the quarry I created that earlier this summer DR. ALLEN: and I'm also working on a paleo climate project with fellow intern Alex Lowe here at the Monument this is called digital leaf physiognomy NARRATOR: hi Alex!, INTERN ALEX: hello DR. ALLEN: and with this we're using leaf fossils to estimate paleo cliamte so as you can see there are many research at the Monument, there's always an exciting project going on and we appreciate that you took the time to visit the Monument NARRATOR: awesome thanks to you and I appreciate everyone here taking time out of their day to show us what they do here as you can see everyone works really really hard but now this concludes our paleo lab tour", "callToAction": "", "callToActionUrl": "", "audioDescribedBuiltIn": false, "hasOpenCaptions": false, "isBRoll": false, "captionFiles": [{"language": "english", "fileType": "text/vtt", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/nps-audiovideo/legacy/closed-caption/imr/avElement/flfo-paleolabtourcaptions2.vtt"}], "versions": [{"fileSizeKb": null, "fileType": "video/mp4", "aspectRatio": 1.778, "heightPixels": 360, "url": "https://www.nps.gov/nps-audiovideo/legacy/flfo/5B8D4947-06ED-64D4-69E83907F8712344/flfo-paleolabtour3_640x360.mp4", "widthPixels": 640}, {"fileSizeKb": null, "fileType": "video/mp4", "aspectRatio": 1.778, "heightPixels": 240, "url": "https://www.nps.gov/nps-audiovideo/legacy/flfo/5B8D4947-06ED-64D4-69E83907F8712344/flfo-paleolabtour3_426x240.mp4", "widthPixels": 426}, {"fileSizeKb": null, "fileType": "video/mp4", "aspectRatio": 1.778, "heightPixels": 480, "url": "https://www.nps.gov/nps-audiovideo/legacy/flfo/5B8D4947-06ED-64D4-69E83907F8712344/flfo-paleolabtour3_854x480.mp4", "widthPixels": 854}]}

It is kind of average for this time of year, average level. I am basically at the ground level for upkeeping the hydrology network in the park. We take field measurements to support the measurements taken by these sensors out here in the marsh. Which would be comprised of Shark Slough, Taylor Slough, and other surrounding areas. There is probably about 60 of these stations taking physical parameters like stage, water level, rain fall\u2026 Here, we have got the difference between surface and bottom temperature. Basically, if you could imagine, we are able to generate a profile of the hydrology here in the park. We have come a long way in data sharing with lots of other agencies\u2026 Ahhh, there is a frog in there. People from lots of other agencies have access to our data. In some cases on a daily basis. Chiefly among them would be Army Corps of Engineer and South Florida Water Management District. Their concern is in operations. Those two agencies operate a lot of the water control structures that deliver water into the park. We also have park biologists who have interest in water data and drawing insights on water conditions and how it relates to resource management concerns. I have not seen one mosquito today. That is one of the things that I like about being in the middle of the slough. It is nice and sunny. There are plenty of fish to eat the mosquito larvae. There are good field conditions out here. Right now, we are in early May. This is the peak of the dry season, sooo. At this time of the year, we have to get to these remote sites by helicopter. Which is quite a costly way to access these sites. And then, once the waters recharge in the park, then our main way of access is by airboat. This is a deep wilderness part of the park. We are about thirty miles away from the nearest road. The helicopter is a very different experience from the airboat. Both have their merits. In the helicopter, you get a more panoramic view, a real landscape perspective. But, traveling by airboat is really nice because you get to feel more immersed. Although these datas are transmitted everyday via either radio telemetry or satellite, it is still necessary to come out here, verify that the sensors are accurately measuring. And also, clean them from the elements. One of my favorite aerial views is coming across the transition area of the freshwater grassy slough into the coastal rivers on the west side. These are mangrove lined tidal creeks that are tributaries that flow into Shark River. We are actually near the end of the Everglades watershed where it is beginning to mingle with the coastal area of the Gulf Coast. We measure several parameters. Water level is one of them. Right now, it is the depths of the dry season. So, at most of the sites that we will be looking at today, it will be below the surface of the ground. This is particularly important this time of the year to inventory our baseline water level before the rainy season hits. There was only less than an inch of rain over this period of time. We have been experiencing a below average rainfall for this dry season. It is very stark to see how important these residual water holes are for wildlife. It is very distinct seeing the animal tracks to and from these water reservoirs. A lot of these monitoring sites happen to be colocated in these deeper holes which in the dry season are particularly favored by alligators and other wildlife. Rain is collected into this funnel. It seeps down into these receptacles. And, the way it is calibrated is 1/100th of an inch of rain will cause it to tip. As it tips, this bar passes over this magnet which closes a circuit and the data logger will record that one tip as 1/100th of an inch of rain. Yeah, I like my job. I have been working here for over six years. I grew up in the south Florida area, studied environmental studies. And, took a particular concern to issues on the Everglades which are very water-related. And, it was kind of a natural path for me to follow. Half of my job consists of field work and the other half, I am at my office reviewing data, making reports, running the numbers. Oh look, I dumped it on top of a baby gator. I have seen a good amount of wildlife at this particular site. Alligators, night herons, soft-shelled turtles, Anhingas. So far today, we have seen a mother and two baby gators. There is probably more\u2026 Oh, there is a third right there. The Everglades is really distinguished by a dualistic climate. A really distinct dry season and a monsoon-like wet season. About 80% of the annual rainfall falls between a six-month period. This creates a really harsh dynamic of which a lot of the flora and fauna are well-adapted to. So, looking out at this prairie, it looks like vast wilderness. Uninterrupted, undisturbed, left to work out its natural processes. But, in reality, it is a very closely managed system. It is closely managed by canals, pumps, levees and other water control structures, mainly located on the periphery of the park boundary.

A channel which is exploring this, the Great Lakes region of North America and the crucial impact it had as a war zone in this tremendous clash of arms between the years 1812 and 1815. In our first series we allowed each site in our family to showcase their grounds and contribute their story in the overall narrative of this theater of combat on the front lines between the United States here and Canada and as staff members at these various institutions we gained an incredible sense of camaraderie and accomplishment from this undertaking and it inspired us to continue with new themes in the face of growing support from viewership in the online community this popularity and camaraderie has attracted new historical sites to Guns Across\u00a0\u00a0the Lakes And we are more than happy to embrace them and have these new sites enrich our storytelling ability and add color and detail to our little historic record. So before we proceed with the focus of our second season it would be only fair to feature these new sites in their own episodes allowing them to introduce the significance of their ideas and properties to you. And it's our hope that you not only eagerly view this visual education but that it inspires you to visit all of our sites and gain for yourself a sense of the respect due to this tremendous story. It will work just as before each Friday throughout the fall we will launch a new episode and when this fresh round of introductions is complete I will return to push us into new territory and new themes for the second chapter of Guns Across the Lakes.

So if you\u2019re ready, let\u2019s get started. Along the Pictured rocks National Lakeshore, in the fall of each year, it\u2019s not uncommon to have marine forecasts issued that can call for maximum potential wave height of up to 25 feet. This occurs a result of strong north or northwest winds that can create large waves over a distance of 160 miles until they reach the shoreline area represented by the blue bar. This 80 mile stretch of Lake Superior, known as the shipwreck coast, gets pounded by these waves and Pictured Rocks makes up the west half of the blue bar. Of the 45 recorded shipwrecks in the waters along the park, 28 or almost two-thirds occurred in September, October or November when these strong winds are prevalent. The other element contributing to the wrecks in this area is the thick, dense fog that can form swiftly. Today Spray falls is a popular kayak and boat destination but one of the most tragic shipwrecks occurred at this location in late October of 1856. The side-wheeler steamer Superior in heavy seas lurched off course. Attempts to lighten the load were unsuccessful and as she took on water the boiler fires were extinguished. Foundering on the rocks, passengers were washed overboard and had to swim in frigid waters to the lakeshore. Between 35 and 42 people perished in this wreck. Today this bell, which can be viewed in the museum at the Au Sable Light Station, is one of the few artifacts that remains from this tragedy. Walking from the lower Hurricane day use area to the Au Sable Light Station allows visitors to view the remains of three other shipwrecks. The Mary Jarecki, a wooden freight steamer heavily laden with iron ore, ran off its course and became lost in fog off the mouth of the Hurricane river before grounding ashore on July 4th of 1883. Today the remains may still be seen resting on the sandstone bottom just off the beach near the trail to the lighthouse. The long oak keelsons studded with iron nails are just below the surface. As you continue towards the lighthouse you can access a set of stairs to a sandy beach for the last third of the walk. From here you can see the remains of two ships, the Sitka and the Gale Staples. Because each of these ships, wooden bulk freighters, are almost identical in size, shape and type of construction, it\u2019s tough to tell which piece belongs to which ship. The Sitka grounded in 1904 while the Gale Staples grounded in 1918. Both ships were able to get their crews to shore with no loss of life. As you continue your walk to the lighthouse you can enjoy views of this wreckage along the beach. With the invention of marine radios, gps, and radar the shipping on this big lake finally became much safer. The last recorded wrecks in the Pictured Rocks area happened in the late 1940s. I hope you get a chance to explore these when you visit Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore.", "callToAction": "", "callToActionUrl": "", "audioDescribedBuiltIn": false, "hasOpenCaptions": false, "isBRoll": false, "captionFiles": [{"language": "english", "fileType": "text/vtt", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/nps-audiovideo/closed-caption/72305143-B2B1-6D8C-3FD3F14B9821FE13.vtt"}], "versions": [{"fileSizeKb": 18717.0, "fileType": "video/mp4", "aspectRatio": 1.778, "heightPixels": 360, "url": "https://www.nps.gov/nps-audiovideo/audiovideo/45c0b9f3-0efa-4d8e-99cc-8eda9ce4b3e2360p.mp4", "widthPixels": 640}, {"fileSizeKb": 25641.0, "fileType": "video/mp4", "aspectRatio": 1.778, "heightPixels": 480, "url": "https://www.nps.gov/nps-audiovideo/audiovideo/45c0b9f3-0efa-4d8e-99cc-8eda9ce4b3e2480p.mp4", "widthPixels": 854}, {"fileSizeKb": 88367.0, "fileType": "video/mp4", "aspectRatio": 1.778, "heightPixels": 720, "url": "https://www.nps.gov/nps-audiovideo/audiovideo/45c0b9f3-0efa-4d8e-99cc-8eda9ce4b3e2720p.mp4", "widthPixels": 1280}, {"fileSizeKb": 148673.0, "fileType": "video/mp4", "aspectRatio": 1.778, "heightPixels": 1080, "url": "https://www.nps.gov/nps-audiovideo/audiovideo/45c0b9f3-0efa-4d8e-99cc-8eda9ce4b3e21080p.mp4", "widthPixels": 1920}]}
