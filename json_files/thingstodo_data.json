This high-elevation lake (5,850 feet) offers spectacular views of the towering Lassen Peak and Chaos Crags volcanoes.\u00a0<br /> <br /> More than 300 years ago, a rock avalanche from Chaos Crags dammed Manzanita Creek creating this shallow lake. With a deepest point of\u00a0only 30 feet, trout often cruise the lake's large, shallow flats in search of food. Due to the large number of visitors to the lake, the fish are not easily spooked by humans.</p> <h4><strong>Regulations</strong></h4> <p>To ensure the availabilty of fish for all visitors, <strong>fishing in this lake is limited to catch and release with a single, barbless hook</strong>. Only lures and flies are permitted; no living or non-living bait may be used.\u00a0The lake is not stocked, however fish stocking did occur prior to the park's establishment in 1916. A California State fishing license is requred. Please review all <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lavo/learn/management/fishing_regulations.htm\">fishing regulations</a> prior to fishing in the park.</p> <h4><b>Boating</b></h4> <p>Kayaks, canoes, waders, and float tubes are commonly used. Only non-motorized boats are permitted (boats may not carry or use a motor).\u00a0All watercraft must be\u00a0launched from the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/ml-day-use-area.htm\">boat launch</a> to prevent damage to the shoreline wetlands.\u00a0</p> <h4>Rod and Reel</h4> <p>For fishing with a rod and reel it is recommended that clear six-pound test line or smaller be used. At times the lake is crystal clear, and fish can see heavier line. A light spinning reel and nimble rod are a good choice for casting long distances and a sporting fight.</p> <h4>Fly Fishing</h4> <p>Manzanita Lake is nationally known for its fly-fishing opportunities. For fly fishing, a six-weight rod is recommended with a length of 9 to 10.5 feet with a #5 or #6 leader. Due to the abundance of willows around the lake, fly fishing can be challanging. Waders are advised. Most flies will work, however a few popular flies that work throughout the park are:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Callibaetis (#16-18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p> </li> <li> <p>Damsel Nymph (#14)</p> </li> <li> <p>Parachute Adams (#14-20)</p> </li> <li> <p>Traditional Adams (#16-20)</p> </li> <li> <p>Callibaetis Cripple (#14-16)</p> </li> <li> <p>Carpenter Ant (#14-16)</p> </li> <li> <p>Bouface brown (#10)</p> </li> <li> <p>Monroe leech, olive (#10)</p> </li> </ul> <p><strong>\u00a0Manzanita Lake Specific Flies:</strong></p> <ul> <li> <p>Midge Patterns</p> </li> <li> <p>Pupa Patterns,</p> </li> <li> <p>Callibraetis Nymphs</p> </li> <li> <p>Damselfly Nymphs</p> </li> <li> <p>Stripping Nymphs,</p> </li> <li> <p>Leech Patterns\u00a0</p> </li> <li> <p>Wooly Buggers</p> </li> </ul>", "reservationDescription": "<p>There are no reservations for park entrance or for fishing.</p>", "season": ["Summer", "Fall"], "topics": [{"id": "1608649A-E7D7-4529-BD83-074C90F9FB68", "name": "Fish"}, {"id": "1CF1F6BB-A037-445B-8CF2-81428E50CE52", "name": "Lakes"}], "durationDescription": "", "arePetsPermitted": "false", "timeOfDay": ["Day", "Dawn", "Dusk"], "duration": "0-10 Hours", "credit": ""}

If you are interested in backcountry or wilderness hiking along the Pacific Coast, click <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/olym/planyourvisit/wilderness.htm\">here</a>. <h2>Beach Safety</h2> <br /> Before you learn about the beaches of Olympic National Park and choose your destination, be sure to read through these beach safety rules! <ul> <li><strong>Don't get trapped by a rising tide!\u00a0</strong>Several points along the coast are only passable at lower tides. Always carry a tide chart. Tide charts are available at visitor centers and ranger stations. Know when the tides will occur (don't guess!) and plan your hike accordingly.</li> <li>Strong winds and storms can significantly elevate tides and create hazardous conditions. Pay attention to your surroundings and\u00a0<strong>never underestimate the power of the Pacific Ocean!</strong></li> <li>Powerful waves can roll and tumble driftwood logs. <b>Do not play on beach logs</b>, especially when the tide is high.</li> <li><strong>Rip currents are dangerous!\u00a0</strong>Swim at your own risk. Learn more about how to spot rip currents and what to do if you're caught in one <a href=\"https://www.weather.gov/tae/ripcurrentawareness\">here</a>.</li> </ul> <h2>Kalaloch and Ruby Beach</h2> <br /> Looking for a mellow, accessible, or pet-friendly trip to the beach? Kalaloch and Ruby Beach are great picks!<br /> <br /> Kalaloch is located along US Highway 101. A ranger station is open in summer months. Overnight visitors can camp at the year-round <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/olym/planyourvisit/camping.htm\">Kalaloch Campground</a> or stay at the concessioner-operated <a href=\"https://www.thekalalochlodge.com/\">Kalaloch Lodge</a>. The Kalaloch Creek Nature Trail begins near the entrance to the campground and offers an easy loop through a coastal forest. Trails from the lodge and campground lead to a sandy beach below a bluff. The beach near Kalaloch is a fantastic place to birdwatch, watch the sunset, and take a look at the Tree of Life - a truly epic tree balanced on the bluff that can be a great spot for photos! If you visit the Tree of Life, or any Kalaloch beaches, please be sure to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/leave-no-trace-seven-principles.htm\">Leave No Trace</a> and use caution when walking around areas with lots of driftwood.<br /> <br /> Ruby Beach is located just 7.5 miles north of Kalaloch and has an accessible viewpoint, parking lot, and restrooms. At this point along the coast, Cedar Creek feeds into the Pacific Ocean. Explore fascinating geology and tide pools on this beach - but watch your step for driftwood, which can sometimes cover parts of this beach!<br /> <br /> Pets are allowed on Kalaloch area beaches and at Ruby Beach. Pets must be on a leash at all times. Pet waste must be picked up and disposed of properly. Learn more about bringing pets to Olympic National Park <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/olym/planyourvisit/pets.htm\">here</a>.<br /> <br /> Learn more about visiting Kalaloch and Ruby Beach <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/olym/planyourvisit/visiting-kalaloch-and-ruby-beach.htm\">here</a>. <h2>Rialto Beach</h2> <br /> Rocky Rialto Beach features giant drift logs, pounding waves, and views of offshore islands known as \"seastacks.\" Get to Rialto Beach from Highway 101 by traveling east on State Route 110 (also known as La Push Road), then turning right on Mora Road to cross the Quillayute River. On the way to Rialto Beach, you'll pass through the Mora area, which includes a seasonally-operated ranger station, nature trails, restrooms, and a campground. At the end of Mora Road, you'll reach the beach! A 200-foot path to the beach is made accessible by a temporary ramp in summer months.<br /> <br /> Feeling adventurous? Hike 1.5 miles north along Rialto Beach to Hole-in-the-Wall, an arching rock formation. Be sure to check tide tables before you hike! If you're planning to continue north along the North Coast Trail, you'll need a wilderness permit and a bear can.<br /> <br /> Pets are allowed at Rialto Beach, but only from the parking lot to Ellen Creek.\u00a0Pets must be on a leash at all times. Pet waste must be picked up and disposed of properly. Learn more about bringing pets to Olympic National Park <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/olym/planyourvisit/pets.htm\">here</a>.<br /> <br /> Learn more about visiting Rialto Beach and the Mora area <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/olym/planyourvisit/visiting-mora-and-rialto.htm\">here</a>. <h2>Second and Third Beaches</h2> <br /> Looking for both a forest hike and a day at the beach? Second and Third Beaches are great spots to see the interplay between coastal forests and sandy beaches.<br /> <br /> Trailheads to Second and Third Beaches can be found along State Route 110 (also known as La Push Road).<br /> <br /> As you drive along this road, you will first come to the trailhead for Third Beach. The trail to Third Beach takes you through a forested area for 1.4 miles before descending 270 feet to a sandy beach. If you're planning to continue south on the South Coast Trail to Oil City, you'll need a wilderness permit and a bear can.<br /> <br /> The trail to Second Beach begins at a parking lot located on the Quileute Indian Reservation. Please be respectful and\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/leave-no-trace-seven-principles.htm\">Leave No Trace</a>\u00a0during your visit to the reservation. Travel south along the .7-mile trail into the national park, winding through a coastal forest before descending 200 feet to a sandy beach with seastacks and tidepools.<br /> <br /> Pets are not allowed on the trails to Second and Third Beaches, or on the beaches themselves. <h2>Ozette</h2> <br /> Can't decide if you want to visit the ocean or a lake? Take a trip to Ozette! The Ozette area of Olympic National Park is reached via the Hoko-Ozette Road off Highway 112. A parking lot is located near a seasonally-operated ranger station, accessible restrooms, picnic areas, and a campground. From here, get a look at beautiful Lake Ozette, then embark on one of two trails leading to the beach: the 3.1-mile Cape Alava Trail or the 2.8-mile Sandpoint Trail. The two trails connect via the Ozette Loop to create a 9-mile loop.<br /> <br /> Only have time to pick one trail? Pick your beach preference! The Cape Alava Trail leads through prairies and forests and ends at a rocky beach. The Sandpoint Trail leads through the coastal forest to a wide, sandy beach.<br /> <br /> Both the Cape Alava and Sandpoint Trails are mostly covered by boardwalks. In frosty or wet conditions, watch your step! Boardwalks can become slippery.<br /> <br /> Pets are not allowed on the Ozette area trails or on the beach itself.<br /> <br /> Learn more about visiting Ozette <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/olym/planyourvisit/visiting-ozette.htm\">here</a>. <h2>Start planning your trip!</h2> <br /> Find more information to start planning your trip to Olympic National Park <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/olym/planyourvisit/index.htm\">here</a>.", "reservationDescription": "", "season": ["Winter", "Spring", "Summer", "Fall"], "topics": [{"id": "46FC5CBD-9AD5-48F1-B4DA-1357031B1D2E", "name": "Coasts, Islands and Atolls"}, {"id": "0E6D8503-CB65-467F-BCD6-C6D9E28A4E0B", "name": "Oceans"}, {"id": "5BE55D7F-BDB6-4E3D-AC35-2D8EBB974417", "name": "Trails"}], "durationDescription": "", "arePetsPermitted": "true", "timeOfDay": ["Day", "Dawn", "Dusk"], "duration": "", "credit": ""}

New paddleboarders can practice in the sheltered waters of Munising Bay.<br /> <br /> Generally, there are three boating areas easy to access within the park: Lake Superior (and Munising Bay), Little Beaver Lake (which connects to Beaver Lake), and Grand Sable Lake. <strong>Pets are not allowed in boats on Little Beaver or Beaver Lakes, since they are within the Beaver Basin Wilderness.\u00a0</strong>\u00a0</p> <h4><strong>IF BOATING ON LAKE SUPERIOR...</strong></h4> <p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><strong>Safety First!</strong></span> Check the marine weather forecast before venturing out.

It is usually between 14.5 - 18 feet long, and between 18 to 24 inches wide.\u00a0Sea kayaks have bulkheads to prevent water from flooding the entire boat.\u00a0<strong>A sea kayak is the only type of kayak that should be used on Lake Superior.</strong></p> </li> <li> <p>A\u00a0<strong>recreational or general purpose kayak\u00a0</strong>is for the casual paddler on placid rivers, ponds, or small lakes. It is smaller than 14 feet long and has a larger opening for the paddler to sit in.\u00a0Recreational kayaks\u00a0<strong>should\u00a0</strong><u><strong>NOT</strong></u>\u00a0be used on Lake Superior or used on windy days.</p> </li> <li> <p>A\u00a0<strong>canoe</strong>\u00a0is an open boat that is wider than a kayak. Their height makes them hard to control in windy conditions on open water.

And then practice, practice, practice!<br /> <br /> Always wear your life jacket! Wear a wetsuit. Cold water kills!<br /> <br /> Paddle with others. Make sure they know how to perform rescues too.<br /> <br /> Leave a float plan with someone who cares about you. This includes information such as your name, type of boat and equipment used, and your planned route and schedule.

Head east out of Munising on County Road H-58 one mile and turn left on Washington Street. (Watch for road signs to Munising Falls and Sand Point.) The Munising Falls parking lot is across from the hospital. Walk the paved 800-ft. trail to Munising Falls. Afterwards, drive two more miles down Sand Point Road to the beaches at the end. Enjoy stunning views of Grand Island across the bay. Both Munising Falls and Sand Point have plowed roads and parking lots that can be accessed by vehicle in winter. <strong>Leashed pets allowed.</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>Sand Point / Sand Point Marsh Trail</strong><br /> You can easily spend an hour at Sand Point walking the beach and also exploring the 1/2 mile boardwalk Sand Point Marsh Trail through some of the park's most beautiful wetlands. See directions to Sand Point above. The wheelchair-accessible trail loop begins at the main Sand Point Beach parking lot. This is a great place for kids, bird watchers, and all nature lovers. <strong>Pets are not allowed on the Sand Point Marsh Trail</strong>.<br /> <br /> <strong>Miners Falls</strong><br /> The parking lot for the Miners Falls trail is approximately 9 miles from Munising. Follow County Road H-58 five miles east to Miners Castle Road (H-11). Turn left and go four miles north to the turn-off for Miners Falls. Turn right and drive 1/2 mile to parking lot. From the parking lot, the trail is 1.2 miles round-trip. The gently rolling trail goes through a beautiful northwoods forest, ending at two viewing platforms for Miners Falls. <strong>Leashed pets allowed.</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>Miners Castle / Miners Beach</strong> <p>You can spend as little or as much time as you like at these two locations - however, they are both doable in an hour. Miners Castle is approximately 11 miles from Munising. Follow County Road H-58 five miles east to Miners Castle Road (H-11). Turn left and go six miles north to Miners Castle. This is the only place where you can drive on the cliffs. The main viewing platform is just a short walk from the parking lot. Allow at least a half hour at Miners Castle if you want to walk to all three viewing platforms. <strong>Leashed pets allowed on paved (not dirt) trails, at viewing platforms, and in picnic area.</strong></p> <br /> Once you leave the Miners Castle parking lot, take the first left and drive the road one mile to the Miners Beach parking lot. You can take a quick walk out to the beach just to see the view or spend more time there. Allow at least a half hour if you want to walk west down the beach to Miners River and back. <strong>Leashed pets allowed on beach and in water.</strong><br /> \u00a0 <p><strong>COMING FROM GRAND MARAIS</strong>: <strong>(east side of the park)</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>Sable Falls / Sable Beach</strong><br /> Drive one mile west of the town of Grand Marais on County Road H-58\u00a0to the Sable Falls parking lot. A short walk from the parking lot leads to a long staircase of 168 steps down to the main falls viewing platform. After viewing the\u00a0falls, continue on the trail along Sable Creek for another 1/4 mile out to Sable Beach. Enjoy the views of the Grand Sable Dunes towering\u00a0to the left and the expanse of Lake Superior ahead. <strong>Leashed pets allowed.</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>Grand Sable Dunes Trail</strong><br /> The 0.6 roundtrip trail to the Grand Sable Dunes also begins in the Sable Falls area. Park at the Sable Falls parking lot and walk towards the falls. The intersection of the Grand Sable Dunes Trail begins near the top of the falls. The trail goes through an old homestead field, across Sable Creek, through a\u00a0forested dune ecosystem, and ends on top of the dunes. Once at the top, walk a short distance to the right for a spectacular view of Lake Superior. The trail\u00a0is fairly level, but there are some uphill sections of walking in sand. <strong>Pets are not allowed on the Grand Sable Dunes Trail.</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>Log Slide</strong><br /> The Log Slide area highlights the logging history of this area and provides a stunning view of the Grand Sable Dunes.<strong>\u00a0</strong>Drive approximately 8 miles west of Grand Marais on County Road H-58 to the Log Slide parking lot. Walk the short path towards the dunes and read the interpretive signs along the way. At the intersection of the North Country Trail you can climb the large dune ahead to get various views. Those who don't want to climb in sand can turn left on the North Country Trail and walk just a few yards to the level spur trail to the right (at the end of the wooden fence). Walk out to the edge of the dune for great views of the sand dunes to the right, and the Au Sable Lighthouse to the left. Take care not to get too close to the dune edge. Watch for poison ivy along the trail. <strong>Pets are not allowed in the Log Slide area or nearby dunes.</strong></p>", "reservationDescription": "", "season": ["Summer", "Fall"], "topics": [{"id": "9C9FCBB6-360B-4743-8155-6F9341CBE01B", "name": "Scenic Views"}], "durationDescription": "", "arePetsPermitted": "true", "timeOfDay": ["Day", "Dawn", "Dusk"], "duration": "1-1 Hours", "credit": ""}

Take another 64 steps down to a lower platform. <strong>Leashed pets allowed.</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>Miners Castle to Miners Beach</strong>\u00a0- Length: 2 miles roundtrip. Take the trail from Miners Castle downhill to Miners Beach, crossing the Miners River along the way. Enjoy the beach and then hike back up - or shorten the walk by having a friend pick you up in the Miners Beach parking lot. <strong>Pets not allowed on the trail.</strong> (However pets are allowed at Miners Castle and at Miners Beach - just not on the trail between the two.)<br /> <br /> <strong>Sable Creek Trail</strong>\u00a0- Length: 2.0 miles roundtrip. Pretty wooded walk between the Grand Sable Visitor Center and the Sable Falls area. The trail offers a stroll through a mature maple forest, along Sable Creek, and through an old farm field. Also intersects the Grand Sable Dunes Trail at 0.8 miles. <strong>Pets not allowed.</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>Au Sable Light Station</strong>\u00a0- Length: 3.0 miles roundtrip. Leaving from Hurricane River Campground, walk on the old access road (part of the North Country Scenic Trail) back in time to an isolated Lake Superior lighthouse. Exposed shipwreck remains dot the shoreline, and the quiet light station gives you a feeling of yesteryear where families lived and worked from 1874 to 1958. Guided tours of the lighthouse are provided in summer. <strong>Leashed pets allowed on road and light station grounds. Bicycles are NOT allowed on this road.</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>White Birch Trail</strong>\u00a0- Length: 2.0 miles.

Please be safe, as drivers often don't know appropriate ways to navigate around cyclists.<br /> <br /> Rim Rock Drive is a 23 mile long scenic road, traveling between the park's east entrance in Grand Junction and the west entrance in Fruita. You\u00a0can turn your ride into a 33 mile loop by using connecting roads outside of the Monument. Parking areas are located by both entrance stations to the Monument.<br /> <br /> When making a decision for just how far to ride, you have some options. Consider how much time you have and your level of fitness while planning your ride. <strong>For the 33 mile loop, the aggregate climb for a complete trip is 2300 vertical feet.</strong>\u00a0You got this. Most of that elevation change is found on the steep grades just inside either entrance. Allow at least three hours for your ride.<br /> <br /> If you would like to ride the Monument without tackling either of the hills (no hate, we totally get that), you can park your vehicle at the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/colm/planyourvisit/visitorcenters.htm\">visitor center</a> to ride across the top of the Monument and back. When the visitor center lot is full, overflow parking is located at the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/colm/planyourvisit/enjoy-a-picnic.htm\">Saddlehorn Picnic Area</a>.<br /> <br /> <strong>A water bottle refilling station is located next to the front doors of the visitor center</strong> and is open 24 hours a day. Bring plenty of water. You'll need to drink lots of water due to high elevation, a strenuous ride, and low humidity. Snacks are a good idea as well.<br /> <br /> <strong>Bicycles are only permitted on the road in the Monument.</strong> Off-road mountain biking is not allowed here, but several adjoining areas are ideal for it. There are options for all skill levels, from beginner to expert.\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.blm.gov/programs/recreation/mountainbike/lunchloops\">Lunch Loops</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.blm.gov/programs/recreation/mountainbike/fruitatrails\">Kokopelli and 18 road</a>, and<a href=\"https://www.visitgrandjunction.com/biking-trails\">\u00a0dozens of other mountain biking trails</a>\u00a0are all located close by.

Vehicles need to allow at least 3 feet between themselves and any bicycle they are passing.</li> <li>You will likely be moving downhill faster than some cars. Do not pass vehicles in the tunnels or on blind curves.</li> <li>Slow down on sharp curves to avoid drifting into oncoming traffic or going off the road. Rim Rock Drive is narrow, with steep drop offs. Going over the edge on some sections of the road could be fatal.</li> <li>Bicycles or riders\u00a0must be equipped with lights visible from the front and rear for safe passage through the tunnels.<strong>\u00a0</strong>Bicyclists must use a white light that is visible from at least 500 feet to the front and a red light that is seen from at least 200 feet from the rear.</li> <li>Bicyclists are required to stop at Stop signs when entrance stations are staffed.</li> <li>Bicyclists are required to pay entrance fees. Annual passes are available and all National Park passes are accepted.</li> <li>On the east side of the Monument, cyclists may encounter large trucks that use four miles of the monument's roadway to access the community of Glade Park.</li> <li>Summer temperatures can go into the low 100s. It's better to start rides early in the morning to avoid the worst of the heat.</li> </ul> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/colm/planyourvisit/bicycle-warning-system.htm\">Learn more about Colorado National Monument's Cyclist Warning System</a></p>", "reservationDescription": "", "season": ["Winter", "Spring", "Summer", "Fall"], "topics": [{"id": "BCE3ACBE-7871-495B-AEA3-5E19BC482405", "name": "Canyons and Canyonlands"}], "durationDescription": "", "arePetsPermitted": "false", "timeOfDay": [], "duration": "2-5 Hours", "credit": ""}

Enjoy the easy grade of the Carbon River Trail (former road) and find yourself in a beautiful setting of old-growth trees, galciers, and the Carbon River.<br /> <br /> The Carbon River area is a remote section of the park, only accessible via\u00a0the Carbon River Road off of SR165. The road is closed at the park entrance, and open to only foot traffic and bicycles beyond that point.\u00a0<em><strong>NOTE:</strong>\u00a0Be prepared to navigate around road and trail washouts and expect to encounter\u00a0hazards such as\u00a0downed trees, snow, and changing weather conditions.</em><br /> <br /> Because of its relatively low elevation of 1,900 feet, the Carbon River area, while remote, is one of the few areas of the park that remains open year-round. During the colder months, the <strong>Carbon River Rainforest Nature Trail</strong> is often accessible. This 0.3-mile roundtrip hike is perfect for families and avid hikers alike. The boardwalk trail has two branches with interpretive signs exploring the unique temperate rain forest of the area (the bridge connecting the two branches on the far side of the trail is washed out). The boardwalk can be wet and slippery or icy.\u00a0The Carbon River rain forest is the only true inland rain forest within the park. Walk along the boardwalk and marvel at the old-growth trees and see what kind of life you can find on the forest floor!\u00a0<br /> <br /> There are many other hikes to explore in the area. If you want a multi-sport kind of adventure, consider starting your journey by <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/bicycling.htm\">bicycle</a>. The <strong>Carbon River Road Trail</strong> once allowed vehicle traffic but has been closed after numerous major washouts and storms. This means visitors can ride their bikes all the way to Ipsut Creek Camp (10 miles round-trip). Exploring by bicycle allows visitors to shave time off their trips and makes many hikes in the area more easily accessible.\u00a0<br /> <br /> The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/old-mine-trailhead.htm\">Old Mine Trail</a>, is 2.9 miles round-trip and begins at the Carbon River Entrance. Follow the Carbon River Trail through temperate rain forest, then take a short spur trail to climb up to the entrance of an old mine, transporting hikers to a time often forgotten.. During the winter, the trail may be snow-covered and fallen trees are common obstacles.\u00a0<br /> <br /> For those wanting to view more natural features, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/green-lake-trailhead.htm\">Green Lake Trail</a>\u00a0is an excellent option. From the Carbon River Entrance, hike or bicycle the Carbon River Trail 3.6 miles to the Green Lake Trailhead, then snowshoe the trail 1.8 miles as it climbs through dense forest to a beautiful mountain lake (10.8 miles round-trip).\u00a0This journey takes visitors to a beautiful cascading waterfall called Ranger Falls before continuing to Green Lake.\u00a0<br /> <br /> Always be prepared for changing weather conditions. The Carbon River area is remote with no cell reception. Ensure that you carry with you the Ten Essentials and always leave your itinerary with a trusted friend or family member who knows when to expect your return. If traveling by bicycle, know how to change a flat and always carry a map. River crossings on the Carbon River are prone to wash outs in fall, winter, and spring. Be prepared to turn back if you encounter washouts. Bikes are only allowed on the Carbon River Road and are not allowed on any trails. Each trailhead has bike racks.

Longmire has much to offer in winter, from visitor services to lower elevation snowshoeing.<br /> <br /> For those looking to get outside, start with a stroll around the 0.7 mile-loop <strong>Trail of the Shadows</strong> to view bubbling mineral springs. During the winter, this trail often has a firm boot pack suitable for hiking or it can be snowshoed. The mineral springs do not reach high temperatures but stay just warm enough to not freeze. Follow a spur trail into the Longmire Meadow to view Mount Rainier and watch for wildlife. Birds, deer, and other animals frequent the area even in winter.\u00a0<br /> <br /> If the snow is too deep or\u00a0you are looking for a more casual walk, follow the plowed road through Longmire.\u00a0Built in the style of National Park Service Rustic Architecture, buildings in Longmire are part of a designated\u00a0<strong>National Historic Landmark District</strong>. The\u00a0Longmire Administration Building is an excellent example,\u00a0constructed of large boulders and logs to match the area\u2019s natural surroundings.\u00a0Continue across the wood\u00a0suspension bridge over the Nisqually River\u00a0to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/longmire-community-building-viewpoint.htm\">Longmire Community Building</a>. The view of Mount Rainier from in the front of the community building is one of the best in the park. The historic Longmire Community Building is closed to visitors, but take a moment to visit the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/valor-memorial.htm\">Valor Memorial</a>, located next to the Community Building.\u00a0While interpretive signs for\u00a0the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/longmire-historic-district-walking-tour.htm\">Longmire Historic District Walking Tour</a>\u00a0are removed during the winter, you can still pick up a map at the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/hours.htm\">Longmire Museum</a>\u00a0or follow the 1.25-mile, round-trip, self-guided tour using the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/digital/nps-apps.htm\">NPS App</a>. The Trail of the Shadows is also a self-guided tour in the app. Pets are permitted along the road/paths\u00a0in the Longmire Historic District, but are <strong>not</strong> permitted on any trails, including Trail of the Shadows.\u00a0<br /> <br /> For those with snowshoes, orienteering skills, and experience with winter hiking, longer trails in the area include:\u00a0</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/wonderland-trail-longmire-trailhead.htm\">Wonderland Trail from Longmire</a>\u00a0<strong>to Cougar Rock Campground</strong>. Starting from Longmire, a section of the Wonderland Trail meanders parallel to the Nisqually River with a gentle incline to reach Cougar Rock Campground after 1.4 miles one-way. The Wonderland Trail continues over the Nisqually River at the Carter Falls crossing near Cougar Rock Campground, but the log footbridge is frequently washed out in winter. Return on the trail to Longmire; do not snowshoe or hike on the Paradise Road when it is closed to vehicles due to hazards from snowplows working on the road.\u00a0</li> <li><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/trail-of-the-shadows-rampart-ridge-trailhead.htm\">Rampart Ridge Trail</a>\u00a0in Longmire is a 4.6 mile-loop with 1,339 feet of elevation gain. The trail begins at the west end of the Trail of the Shadows, approximately 0.2 miles from the trailhead if heading clockwise. The loop can be hiked in either direction but going clockwise provides better views of Mount Rainier. The other end of the trail connects to the Wonderland Trail to return to Longmire. This trail is popular with snowshoers but is unmarked and requires winter navigation skills.</li> </ul> <p>Make sure to stop by the <strong>Longmire Museum</strong> for information about trail conditions and permits. The museum also has exhibits about the nature and history of the area.<br /> <br /> <strong>Cross country skiers</strong> may\u00a0enjoy exploring the snow-covered paths of the Longmire Stewardship Campground located near\u00a0the community building.<br /> <br /> When it\u2019s time to warm up, visit the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/national-park-inn.htm\">National Park Inn</a>. Sit on the veranda with a cup of hot chocolate to enjoy the view or take a break indoors by the fireplace.

Fords were places along the creek where water ran low enough for wagons to cross without needing a bridge. Milkhouse Ford was in frequent use and appears on many old maps. It was paved in 1904 to accommodate automobile traffic. Closed in 1995, the ford is still visible but is no longer accessible. The creek contains bacteria, e. coli and algae that is not safe for humans or pets to swim in.\u00a0\u00a0", "doFeesApply": "false", "longDescription": "<h4><b>For your convenience, this trail is blazed with <span style=\"color:#f1c40f;\">yellow</span> tape wrapped around sign posts.</b><br /> \u00a0</h4> <p><b>Directions from the Nature Center: </b></p> <ul> <li>Walk straight out the front door along the paved path past the Edge of the Woods Trail sign to where the trail forks right. Bear right.This is the Western Ridge Trail. Follow it towards Boundary Bridge.</li> <li>Cross Military Road. (Press button and wait for signal first.)</li> <li>Continue straight for 250 feet. The paved path will go slightly up the hill.</li> <li>Turn right at the outdoor exhibit about Fort DeRussy. This is a six-foot tall sign with information about Fort DeRussy, NOT the smaller sign on the corner in the open field that says \"Fort DeRussy.\"</li> <li>In 100 feet, go straight to stay on the dirt trail. Do not stay on the paved path.\u00a0The earthen walls of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/fort-derussy.htm\">Fort DeRussy</a> will soon be on your left.</li> <li>After the fort, continue down the trail. You will be descending into the Rock Creek Valley. Use caution as the trail can get slippery.</li> <li>Veer to the left when you get to the bottom of the hill. There is a tree trunk that is split on either side of the trail to allow people to pass near the trail intersection. Do not go towards the Military Road overpass.</li> <li>Hike along the creek (up-stream) for \u00bc -mile, and look for a\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/joaquin-miller-cabin.htm\">two-room log cabin</a> across Rock Creek. Joaquin Miller, an eccentric poet, lived in this cabin in another part of the city\u2014Meridian Hill\u2014in the 1880s. It was moved to Rock Creek Park in an effort to preserve it in the early 1900s.</li> <li>Just north of the cabin, look for an old road that runs into the creek. This is <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/milkhouse-ford.htm\">Milkhouse Ford.</a> First paved in 1904, people used to drive through the creek\u2014a major thoroughfare at one time\u2014until the 1990s.<br /> <br /> <span style=\"color:#c0392b;\">For the health and safety of visitors and their pets, swimming and wading in Rock Creek Park is not permitted.</span></li> <li>Walk up the old road bed (away from the creek) for about 100 feet. The Cross Trail will be on your left.</li> <li>Follow the tributary up the gentle slope. Archeological evidence along this trail indicates that it may be 5,000 years old and one of the oldest in the park. Originally used by indigenous peoples to ford the creek and access a quarry and spring (which feeds the tributary) the trail was later used by European settlers and was eventually expanded to accomodate wagons. It was later closed and has reverted to a foot trail.</li> <li>Turn left on the Western Ridge Trail (green blazes).
