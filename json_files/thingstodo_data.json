The overlook platform was destroyed in a winter storm but the path to the platform location is still there. You'll be rewarded with breathtaking views of Lake Superior, the Grand Sable Dunes, and Au Sable Lighthouse in the distance. No pets allowed.<br /> <br /> <strong>Grand Sable Dunes Trail</strong>\u00a0- Length: 0.6 mile roundtrip. This is the main access point into the Grand Sable Dunes. The trail starts at the Sable Falls parking area near the top of the falls, continues past an old orchard and field, and crosses a bridge over Sable Creek. It then winds through a jack pine forest gradually uphill into an open dune environment. Requires some uphill climbing in sand. No pets allowed.<br /> <br /> <strong>Sable Falls Trail</strong>\u00a0\u2013 Length: 0.5 mile roundtrip. From the Sable Falls parking lot, this trail starts with 168 steps down to the base of the falls and and continues past the falls along Sable Creek to a rock and sand beach on Lake Superior. The first landing on the stairs provides a view of Sable Falls, although the best view is from the bottom.

It is usually between 14.5 - 18 feet long, and between 18 to 24 inches wide.\u00a0Sea kayaks have bulkheads to prevent water from flooding the entire boat.\u00a0<strong>A sea kayak is the only type of kayak that should be used on Lake Superior.</strong></li> <li>A\u00a0<strong>recreational or general purpose kayak\u00a0</strong>is for the casual paddler on placid rivers, ponds, or small lakes. It is smaller than 14 feet long and has a larger opening for the paddler to sit in.\u00a0Recreational kayaks\u00a0<strong>should\u00a0</strong><u><strong>NOT</strong></u>\u00a0be used on Lake Superior or used on windy days.</li> <li>A\u00a0<strong>canoe</strong>\u00a0is an open boat that is wider than a kayak. Their height makes them hard to control in windy conditions on open water. Unless packed with flotation, they can also fill with water and more easily swamp.\u00a0Canoes\u00a0<strong>should\u00a0<u>NOT</u></strong>\u00a0be used on Lake Superior!</li> </ul> <br /> If you are using a canoe or recreational kayak, consider paddling on island lakes or nearby rivers (such as the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/hiawatha/recarea/?recid=13322\">Au Train River</a>\u00a0west of the park).

Watch the weather carefully while on the lake.\u00a0The weather can change suddenly and unexpectedly.\u00a0</li> <li>The Pictured Rocks cliffs rise 50 to 200 feet directly from the lake, offering precious few protected places if the wind and waves increase. Also check local weather buoys for real-time data and video from the buoy cams at\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.greatlakesbuoys.org/\">www.greatlakesbuoys.org</a></li> </ul> <h4><br /> Remember...</h4> Cell phones may or may not work at the park. Even if you are able to get a 911 call out, help is still far away, 30 minutes at least. Rescue time of 60 to 90 minutes or longer is more likely. If the weather is very rough, no one will be able to respond until the weather calms down.<br /> <br /> You need to be able to perform a self-rescue. Read, research on-line, take lessons. And then practice, practice, practice!<br /> <br /> Always wear your life jacket! Wear a wetsuit. Cold water kills!<br /> <br /> Paddle with others. Make sure they know how to perform rescues too.<br /> <br /> Leave a float plan with someone who cares about you. This includes information such as your name, type of boat and equipment used, and your planned route and schedule. Don't forget to tell them when you get back so they would know when to start searching.<br /> \u00a0", "reservationDescription": "", "season": ["Summer", "Fall"], "topics": [{"id": "1CF1F6BB-A037-445B-8CF2-81428E50CE52", "name": "Lakes"}], "durationDescription": "", "arePetsPermitted": "true", "timeOfDay": [], "duration": "", "credit": ""}

Watch the weather carefully while on the lake.\u00a0The weather can change suddenly and unexpectedly.\u00a0The Pictured Rocks cliffs rise 50 to 200 feet directly from the lake, offering precious few protected places if the wind and waves increase.

However, horsepower is limited to 50 on Grand Sable Lake.\u00a0<strong>Only electric motors</strong>\u00a0may be used on Little Beaver Lake and Beaver Lake in the Beaver Basin Wilderness.<br /> <br /> Slow \u2013 no wake speed within\u00a0<strong>100 feet</strong>\u00a0of the shoreline, any watercraft, pier, person, raft, swimming area, and swimmers.<br /> <br /> Boats may be launched into Lake Superior at the City of Munising's boat ramp a mile west of the town harbor on M-28. Burt Township maintains a boat ramp in Grand Marais harbor. There are shallow boat ramps on Grand Sable Lake and Little Beaver Lake.<br /> <br /> An appropriate type and size personal flotation device (PFD) (life jacket) is\u00a0<strong>required by law</strong>\u00a0for each person on board any boat. In Michigan, all children under the age of 6 years old must wear a PFD while riding on the open deck of a vessel when it is underway.

Their height makes them hard to control in windy conditions on open water, and they can be easily swamped by waves. Instead take your canoe to one of the park's beautiful inland lakes:\u00a0\u00a0Little Beaver Lake, Beaver Lake, and Grand Sable Lake.\u00a0\u00a0</p> <h4>Sailboats and Paddleboards</h4> <p><strong>Lake Superior</strong> - Small sailboats can be carried from the parking lot to Munising Bay\u00a0at Sand Point Beach. Munising Bay is a good place for sailing and paddleboarding since it is generally a more sheltered area. Larger boats should use the municipal boat ramps listed above.<br /> <strong>Inland Lakes</strong> - Little Beaver Lake, Beaver Lake, and Grand Sable Lake are also suitable for small sailboats and paddleboards.<br /> <br /> <strong style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-size: 1.25rem;\">Personal Watercraft</strong></p> <p>Personal watercraft (PWC) such as jet skis may travel within the lakeshore from the western boundary near\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/piro/planyourvisit/scenicsites.htm#CP_JUMP_3020720\">Sand Point</a>\u00a0to the eastern terminus of\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/piro/planyourvisit/scenicsites.htm#CP_JUMP_3031897\">Miners Beach</a>. PWC are not permitted elsewhere within the lakeshore's one-quarter mile offshore jurisdiction along the Lake Superior shoreline.<br /> <br /> Due to horsepower restrictions, PWC are not allowed on inland lakes within Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore.<br /> <br /> According to State of Michigan law, PWC must not operate from one hour before sunset to 8 am. When traveling within 200 feet of the shoreline, PWC must travel at a slow/no-wake speed perpendicular to the shoreline.</p> <h4><strong>Water Skiing</strong></h4> <p>Water skiing is authorized on Lake Superior and Grand Sable Lake in accordance with state and federal laws.

Please be safe, as drivers often don't know appropriate ways to navigate around cyclists.<br /> <br /> Rim Rock Drive is a 23 mile long scenic road, traveling between the park's east entrance in Grand Junction and the west entrance in Fruita. You\u00a0can turn your ride into a 33 mile loop by using connecting roads outside of the Monument. Parking areas are located by both entrance stations to the Monument.<br /> <br /> When making a decision for just how far to ride, you have some options. Consider how much time you have and your level of fitness while planning your ride. <strong>For the 33 mile loop, the aggregate climb for a complete trip is 2300 vertical feet.</strong>\u00a0You got this. Most of that elevation change is found on the steep grades just inside either entrance. Allow at least three hours for your ride.<br /> <br /> If you would like to ride the Monument without tackling either of the hills (no hate, we totally get that), you can park your vehicle at the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/colm/planyourvisit/visitorcenters.htm\">visitor center</a> to ride across the top of the Monument and back. When the visitor center lot is full, overflow parking is located at the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/colm/planyourvisit/enjoy-a-picnic.htm\">Saddlehorn Picnic Area</a>.<br /> <br /> <strong>A water bottle refilling station is located next to the front doors of the visitor center</strong> and is open 24 hours a day. Bring plenty of water. You'll need to drink lots of water due to high elevation, a strenuous ride, and low humidity. Snacks are a good idea as well.<br /> <br /> <strong>Bicycles are only permitted on the road in the Monument.</strong> Off-road mountain biking is not allowed here, but several adjoining areas are ideal for it.

Vehicles need to allow at least 3 feet between themselves and any bicycle they are passing.</li> <li>You will likely be moving downhill faster than some cars. Do not pass vehicles in the tunnels or on blind curves.</li> <li>Slow down on sharp curves to avoid drifting into oncoming traffic or going off the road. Rim Rock Drive is narrow, with steep drop offs. Going over the edge on some sections of the road could be fatal.</li> <li>Bicycles or riders\u00a0must be equipped with lights visible from the front and rear for safe passage through the tunnels.<strong>\u00a0</strong>Bicyclists must use a white light that is visible from at least 500 feet to the front and a red light that is seen from at least 200 feet from the rear.</li> <li>Bicyclists are required to stop at Stop signs when entrance stations are staffed.</li> <li>Bicyclists are required to pay entrance fees. Annual passes are available and all National Park passes are accepted.</li> <li>On the east side of the Monument, cyclists may encounter large trucks that use four miles of the monument's roadway to access the community of Glade Park.</li> <li>Summer temperatures can go into the low 100s.

The road is closed at the park entrance, and open to only foot traffic and bicycles beyond that point.\u00a0<em><strong>NOTE:</strong>\u00a0Be prepared to navigate around road and trail washouts and expect to encounter\u00a0hazards such as\u00a0downed trees, snow, and changing weather conditions.</em><br /> <br /> Because of its relatively low elevation of 1,900 feet, the Carbon River area, while remote, is one of the few areas of the park that remains open year-round. During the colder months, the <strong>Carbon River Rainforest Nature Trail</strong> is often accessible. This 0.3-mile roundtrip hike is perfect for families and avid hikers alike. The boardwalk trail has two branches with interpretive signs exploring the unique temperate rain forest of the area (the bridge connecting the two branches on the far side of the trail is washed out). The boardwalk can be wet and slippery or icy.\u00a0The Carbon River rain forest is the only true inland rain forest within the park. Walk along the boardwalk and marvel at the old-growth trees and see what kind of life you can find on the forest floor!\u00a0<br /> <br /> There are many other hikes to explore in the area. If you want a multi-sport kind of adventure, consider starting your journey by <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/bicycling.htm\">bicycle</a>. The <strong>Carbon River Road Trail</strong> once allowed vehicle traffic but has been closed after numerous major washouts and storms. This means visitors can ride their bikes all the way to Ipsut Creek Camp (10 miles round-trip). Exploring by bicycle allows visitors to shave time off their trips and makes many hikes in the area more easily accessible.\u00a0<br /> <br /> The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/old-mine-trailhead.htm\">Old Mine Trail</a>, is 2.9 miles round-trip and begins at the Carbon River Entrance. Follow the Carbon River Trail through temperate rain forest, then take a short spur trail to climb up to the entrance of an old mine, transporting hikers to a time often forgotten.. During the winter, the trail may be snow-covered and fallen trees are common obstacles.\u00a0<br /> <br /> For those wanting to view more natural features, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/green-lake-trailhead.htm\">Green Lake Trail</a>\u00a0is an excellent option. From the Carbon River Entrance, hike or bicycle the Carbon River Trail 3.6 miles to the Green Lake Trailhead, then snowshoe the trail 1.8 miles as it climbs through dense forest to a beautiful mountain lake (10.8 miles round-trip).\u00a0This journey takes visitors to a beautiful cascading waterfall called Ranger Falls before continuing to Green Lake.\u00a0<br /> <br /> Always be prepared for changing weather conditions. The Carbon River area is remote with no cell reception. Ensure that you carry with you the Ten Essentials and always leave your itinerary with a trusted friend or family member who knows when to expect your return. If traveling by bicycle, know how to change a flat and always carry a map. River crossings on the Carbon River are prone to wash outs in fall, winter, and spring. Be prepared to turn back if you encounter washouts. Bikes are only allowed on the Carbon River Road and are not allowed on any trails. Each trailhead has bike racks.

Follow the signs for the Guadalupe Peak Trail. Follow the hiker trail; the horse trail will add about 1 extra mile to the trip (although it is less steep).<br /> <br /> You will encounter the steepest part of the hike in the first mile and a half, as the trail switchbacks up the first steep slope. Be sure not to cut across the switchbacks, as this causes accelerated erosion. The views will get better with every switchback you climb.<br /> <br /> After about a mile and a half, the trail will become less steep as it passes a cliff and then turns around to the north-facing slope. Here, hikers will discover a small forest of pinion pine, south-western white pine, and Douglas fir. The forest exists here since on a north-facing slope there is not as much sunlight. The slightly cooler, shadier climate allows these pines to survive.<br /> <br /> After nearly three miles the trail will top out at a false summit. It is still a little more than a mile to the actual summit. The trail will flatten out for a short distance as it passes through a sparse forest of ponderosa pine. The backcountry campsite for overnight backpackers is on this summit (backcountry permit required to camp).<br /> <br /> After passing the backcountry campsite, the trail descends slightly and crosses a wooden bridge. After the bridge, the trail begins the final climb to the summit. After only a few switchbacks, the top of El Capitan will dominate the view to the south.

Head east out of Munising on County Road H-58 one mile and turn left on Washington Street. (Watch for road signs to Munising Falls and Sand Point.) The Munising Falls parking lot is across from the hospital. Walk the paved 800-ft. trail to Munising Falls. Afterwards, drive two more miles down Sand Point Road to the beaches at the end. Enjoy stunning views of Grand Island across the bay. Both Munising Falls and Sand Point have plowed roads and parking lots that can be accessed by vehicle in winter. Pets allowed on leash.<br /> <br /> <strong>Sand Point / Sand Point Marsh Trail</strong><br /> You can easily spend an hour at Sand Point walking the beach and also exploring the 1/2 mile boardwalk Marsh Trail through some of the park's most beautiful wetlands. See directions to Sand Point above. The wheelchair-accessible Marsh Trail begins at the main Sand Point parking lot. This is a great place for kids, bird watchers, and all nature lovers. Pets not allowed on the Sand Point Marsh Trail.<br /> <br /> <strong>Miners Falls</strong><br /> The parking lot for the Miners Falls trail is approximately 9 miles from Munising. Follow County Road H-58 five miles east to Miners Castle Road (H-11). Turn left and go four miles north to the turn-off for Miners Falls. Turn right and drive 1/2 mile to parking lot. From the parking lot, the trail is 1.2 miles round-trip. The gently rolling trail goes through a beautiful northwoods forest, ending at two viewing platforms for Miners Falls. Pets allowed on leash.<br /> <br /> <strong>Miners Castle / Miners Beach</strong> <p>You can spend as little or as much time as you like at these two locations - however, they are both doable in an hour. Miners Castle is approximately 11 miles from Munising. Follow County Road H-58 five miles east to Miners Castle Road (H-11). Turn left and go six miles north to Miners Castle. This is the only place where you can drive on the cliffs. The main viewing platform is just a short walk from the parking lot. Allow at least a half hour at Miners Castle if you want to walk to all three viewing platforms. Pets allowed on leash.</p> <br /> Once you leave the Miners Castle parking lot, take the first left and drive the road one mile to the Miners Beach parking lot. You can take a quick walk out to the beach just to see the view or spend more time there. Allow at least a half hour if you want to walk west down the beach to Miners River and back. Pets allowed on leash<br /> \u00a0 <p><strong>COMING FROM GRAND MARAIS</strong>: <strong>(east side of the park)</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>Sable Falls / Sable Beach</strong><br /> Drive one mile west of the town of Grand Marais on County Road H-58\u00a0to the Sable Falls parking lot. A short walk from the parking lot leads to a long staircase of 168 steps down to the main falls viewing platform. After viewing the\u00a0falls, continue on the trail along Sable Creek for another 1/4 mile out to Sable Beach. Enjoy the views of the Grand Sable Dunes towering\u00a0to the left and the expanse of Lake Superior ahead. Pets allowed on leash.<br /> <br /> <strong>Grand Sable Dunes Trail</strong><br /> The 0.6 roundtrip trail to the Grand Sable Dunes also begins in the Sable Falls area. Park at the Sable Falls parking lot and walk towards the falls. The intersection of the Grand Sable Dunes Trail begins near the top of the falls. The trail goes through an old homestead field, across Sable Creek, through a\u00a0forested dune ecosystem, and ends on top of the dunes. Once at the top, walk a short distance to the right for a spectacular view of Lake Superior. The trail\u00a0is fairly level, but there are some uphill sections of walking in sand. Pets are not allowed on the Grand Sable Dunes Trail.<br /> <br /> <strong>Log Slide</strong><br /> The Log Slide area highlights the logging history of this area and provides a stunning view of the Grand Sable Dunes.<strong>\u00a0</strong>Drive approximately 8 miles west of Grand Marais on County Road H-58 to the Log Slide parking lot. Walk the short path towards the dunes and read the interpretive signs along the way. At the intersection of the North Country Trail you can climb the large dune ahead to get various views. Those who don't want to climb in sand can turn left on the North Country Trail and walk just a few yards to the level spur trail to the right (at the end of the wooden fence). Walk out to the edge of the dune for great views of the sand dunes to the right, and the Au Sable Lighthouse to the left. Take care not to get too close to the dune edge. Watch for poison ivy along the trail.

This blanket term includes but is not limited to canoeing, kayaking, rafting, and stand-up paddle boarding. Because these watercraft are typically smaller than 10 feet, they do not require a state boating license. Because they are human-powered, they are permitted in the federally designated wilderness areas that make up 97% of Mount Rainier National Park. This means paddle sports offer a unique opportunity to get out on the water and experience the truly isolated lakes that are scattered across Mount Rainier.</p> <p>The main obstacle to paddle sports in Mount Rainier National Park is access. All of the lakes that visitors are permitted to recreate on are relatively remote. Modern technology has made watercraft increasingly lightweight and portable. While some watercraft are inflatable, foldable, or packable, at the end of the day getting to the edge of a lake with the requisite equipment remains a challenge. This challenge is what preserves the unique wilderness experience of these remote lakes.</p> <p>All lakes in Mount Rainier National Park are open year-round except those listed below. Accessing lakes during the winter can be very challenging, when many roads close for the season, and lakes are often frozen and snow covered. The following lakes are closed year-round to protect sensitive riparian vegetation:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Tipsoo Lake</p> </li> <li> <p>Shadow Lake</p> </li> <li> <p>Reflection Lake</p> </li> </ul> <p>The following lakes are closed year-round to protect water supplies:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Frozen Lake</p> </li> <li> <p>Ghost Lake</p> </li> </ul> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/mowich-lake.htm\">Mowich Lake</a> is the largest lake in the park and is one that you can both drive to and recreate on, but even here visitors should be prepared to move their equipment over uneven terrain. On the busiest summer weekends, parking limitations might force you to park half a mile or more from the lake shore. Mowich Lake has its own park entrance via SR165 in the northwest corner of the park, which takes time to drive to. Stop by the <strong>Carbon River Ranger Station</strong> at nearby\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/carbon-river.htm\">Carbon River</a>\u00a0before heading up to the lake for maps, information, and wilderness permits if you are planning to camp overnight.\u00a0<br /> <br /> Safety is important when engaging in paddle sports. Water is always dangerous and Mount Rainier's cold mountain lakes are never warm even on the hottest summer days. Because of how isolated the park lakes are, visitors need to be able to self-rescue. This is not the time or place to test new equipment or learn new skills. Always wear a Personal Flotation Device on the water and have a dry change of warm clothes to change into if necessary. Be prepared to make minor repairs to your equipment. Carry food, water, sunscreen, and bug spray.<br /> <br /> <strong>Preserve the lakes.</strong> Thoroughly wash and dry all equipment before and after visiting Mount Rainier National Park to prevent the transport of non-native or invasive species between lakes. Pay special attention to removing mud or vegetation that might be attached to your gear, including clothing and shoes.\u00a0Do not dump any water from other sources into Mount Rainier National Park waters. Each lake is its own fragile ecosystem and it is up to all of us to help keep it that way.<br /> <br /> There are no designated areas along the shore of Mowich Lake to launch water craft. Please avoid trampling meadow plants and other vegetation along the shore and limit your impact when visiting any park lake.\u00a0<br /> <br /> Pets are <strong>not</strong> permitted on any park trails, including around Mowich Lake.\u00a0<br /> <br /> With these simple instructions in mind, you are ready to enjoy a lake experience at Mount Rainier National Park!</p>", "reservationDescription": "", "season": ["Summer", "Fall"], "topics": [{"id": "AEA4C5FD-F25C-4C3D-97FE-2767ED3EE682", "name": "Meadows"}, {"id": "1CF1F6BB-A037-445B-8CF2-81428E50CE52", "name": "Lakes"}, {"id": "101F4D51-F99D-45A6-BBB6-CD481E5FACED", "name": "Mountains"}, {"id": "F8C2FE93-DEB3-4B12-9A87-913E3E6B448D", "name": "Natural Sounds"}, {"id": "9C9FCBB6-360B-4743-8155-6F9341CBE01B", "name": "Scenic Views"}, {"id": "5BE55D7F-BDB6-4E3D-AC35-2D8EBB974417", "name": "Trails"}, {"id": "BA12B386-49EA-46B0-9121-FCACACC47538", "name": "Watersheds"}, {"id": "B85866E2-0897-4000-9040-605CA335804F", "name": "Wilderness"}], "durationDescription": "Take a quick spin around the lake or enjoy the day!

Notice the glacially-fed Nisqually River on your right.\u00a0The first waterfall on this tour ends up flowing into the Nisqually! <strong>Christine Falls</strong> will be on your left approximately four miles up the road from Longmire. The waterfall\u00a0is visible from a bridge along the road, but be sure to park in\u00a0pullouts on either side of the bridge.\u00a0Do not stop in the road and block traffic. Watch out for vehicles if viewing the waterfall from the bridge. From the uphill pullout\u00a0there is a short trail (~100 feet) to the viewpoint of these beautiful falls. While open year-round, the trail to the viewpoint can be steep and icy or blocked by snow during the winter.\u00a0<br /> <br /> From Christine Falls, continue on the road for another four miles, keeping a lookout on the right for the parking lot for <strong>Narada Falls</strong>. At 188 feet tall, this waterfall is the largest that is accessible by car in the park! This waterfall is best seen from the viewpoint, which is reached by a 0.2-mile trail (0.4 mile round-trip) with a steep, 200-foot descent/ascent. The trail can be very icy in winter. However you can also see a view of the top of the falls from the parking lot. There are also bathrooms and picnic tables available at this stop.<br /> <br /> The next waterfall on our tour is <strong>Ruby Falls</strong>, located just about half a mile up the road from Narada. You can access this falls by taking the next right after Narada onto Stevens Canyon Road, and immediately using the pullout\u00a0on the right (parking is limited and do not block the road). This hidden gem is a 53 foot cascade located just under the bridge you parked on, and the cascades can be better seen by walking a bit down the Narada Falls Trail. Both Ruby and Narada falls are along the Paradise River.\u00a0You can also view Ruby Falls by parking at the larger Narada Falls parking area and using the Narada Falls Trail to hike up to Ruby Falls (0.4 miles one-way, with approx 270 feet of elevation gain).\u00a0<br /> <br /> The last waterfall on the tour is perhaps the most spectacular. At 72-feet-high, these falls are perfectly framed by a stunning view of the mountain behind them. <strong>Myrtle Falls</strong> is best accessed from the Paradise\u00a0upper parking lot. From there, you can take the steps behind the visitor center, and take the next right following the signs for the falls along the Skyline Trail. This paved trail is one mile round-trip, with about 100 feet of elevation gain. Be aware that you will have plenty of company here! This viewpoint is one of the most photographed spots in the park. NOTE: The short spur trail from the Skyline Trail down to the Myrtle Falls viewpoint is temporarily closed for repairs in 2023, but you can view the top of the falls from a bridge along the Skyline Trail.\u00a0</p>", "reservationDescription": "", "season": ["Spring", "Summer", "Fall"], "topics": [{"id": "F0F97E32-2F29-41B4-AF98-9FBE8DAB36B1", "name": "Geology"}, {"id": "101F4D51-F99D-45A6-BBB6-CD481E5FACED", "name": "Mountains"}, {"id": "A155238F-0DD2-4610-9B87-05FCE1C59283", "name": "River and Riparian"}, {"id": "9C9FCBB6-360B-4743-8155-6F9341CBE01B", "name": "Scenic Views"}, {"id": "5BE55D7F-BDB6-4E3D-AC35-2D8EBB974417", "name": "Trails"}, {"id": "0BBD4A42-2B3D-4E82-B5C4-1A3874C8682E", "name": "Roads, Routes and Highways"}, {"id": "5ED826E0-76BB-47BB-87DD-E081A72B0A04", "name": "Waterfalls"}, {"id": "BA12B386-49EA-46B0-9121-FCACACC47538", "name": "Watersheds"}], "durationDescription": "", "arePetsPermitted": "false", "timeOfDay": ["Day", "Dawn", "Dusk"], "duration": "2-4 Hours", "credit": ""}
