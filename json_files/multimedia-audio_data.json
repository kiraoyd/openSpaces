Actually, it was a very freeing thing.\u201d George Fox, founder of the Religious Society of Friends in 17th century England, was quite forward thinking about the role of women in the Quaker faith. Pastor Ruthie Tippin of the West Branch Friends Church reveals that in 1671, Fox requested that women have their own place to do business at their \u201cmonthly meetings.\u201d It was during those meetings that the sliding wooden partitions dividing the room were pulled down. (sound effects: roller partition closing) Ruthie Tippin: (music) \u201cThe idea was to give women opportunities to learn how to lead, to learn how to clerk or chair a meeting, to take roles in leadership within their community. And oftentimes he had seen that men would take over those roles in mixed company, and it was better, he felt, for women to exercise those kinds of qualities on their own. And from that came this divided business meeting concept, and it flourished, and it strengthened women\u2019s' voices; it strengthened women\u2019s place in leadership, not only in the Friends church, but in all of life.\u201d Hoover\u2019s mother Hulda was one who did not hesitate to take on a leadership role within the meeting. She helped conduct revivals, founded and led a young people\u2019s prayer meeting, and took an active role in prohibition campaigns. After her husband\u2019s death, the thirty-two year old widow became even more focused on the two things that brought her joy: her children and her faith.

(sound effects: native birds) Isaac Miles was a widower with two young daughters when he moved to West Branch in 1874 and opened a drugstore. Three years later, he met and married a young woman, who had inherited 100 acres of farmland to the southwest of the Hoover cottage. So Miles sold his drugstore and decided to give farming a try. And as soon as the two-story frame house and barn were built, the new family moved in. Isaac's daughters, Providence and Abbie were around the same age as the Hoover children, and it's likely they played together in this rural playground filled with natural wonders. (music) Iowa farmsteads were laid out according to the character of the land. Rolling hills could serve as pasture or as a partial support for buildings like a barn. Where the ground was flat, crops were planted; (sound effects: chickens, rooster) outbuildings like chicken coops were constructed close to the home, but definitely downwind, to make for a short walk in the winter. And a road was leveled to give the farmer access to railroads and markets where he could sell his harvest. An 1880 census showed that Miles had managed to get 73 acres under cultivation with corn, oats, rye, potatoes, and apples. He also raised 5 milk cows, 5 beef cattle, 55 pigs, and 20 chickens. Farming did provide for Isaac and his family, but in 1882, Isaac became involved with his father Benjamin in the establishment of a Quaker-inspired school to educate Native American children in the industrial arts. It was during this time, when some of the Osage, Cheyenne, and Arapaho children lived and worked on the Miles Farm, that 8-year old Bert Hoover fished and hunted the countryside with them, learned the lore of the woods, and how to make bows and arrows.", "callToAction": "", "callToActionUrl": "", "versions": [{"fileSize": 2918527.0, "fileType": "audio/mp3", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/nps-audiovideo/audiovideo/d2978da0-dd68-4c2b-a3b4-7bccfc469983.mp3"}]}

Today the buildings that once stood here are gone, but the intersection between Bullock Road and Elys Ford Road is the same one travelled during the war. This region of Virginia was known as the Wilderness of Spotsylvania County. It was a sparsely populated area with more dense thickets and second growth forests than agricultural clearings. The Orange Turnpike, modern-day Route 3 , extended from Fredericksburg westward and passed through the Wilderness. About 4 miles north of this spot is the confluence of the Rapidan and Rappahannock Rivers. A network of roads connected the Orange Turnpike to the rivers, but there were also many informal paths that could make travelling here difficult without an accurate map. The Confederates spent the winter on this side of the river, so they were familiar with the terrain. While the Army of the Potomac did not have the same first-hand experience, Hooker\u2019s intelligence gathering enabled him to plan and execute complicated troop movements. Hooker\u2019s plan was to lay a trap for Robert E. Lee. He knew that the Army of the Potomac outnumbered the Army of Northern Virginia over 2 to 1 and that the Confederates were dependent on the Richmond, Fredericksburg, and Potomac railroad track for what little supplies they had. With these factors in mind, Hooker planned to split his army and surround Lee, force Lee out of his defensives at Fredericksburg, and cut the Confederate supply line. To cut off Lee\u2019s supplies, Hooker would utilize almost his entire cavalry. On April 29, US cavalry under the command of General George Stoneman rode across the Rappahannock at Kelly\u2019s Ford and set off on a deep sweeping raid into Lee\u2019s rear. Their intention was to tear up railroad tracks, destroy bridges, and deprive the Confederates of supplies and reinforcements. Hooker deduced that if Lee lost access to the railroad, the Army of Northern Virginia would have to retreat. On April 27, portions of the Army of the Potomac began marching westward, aiming to go around and over the river to end up behind Lee\u2019s Confederates in Fredericksburg. As the US forces began crossing Kelly\u2019s Fords on April 28, the US 6th Corp, stationed across from Fredericksburg provided a distraction by loudly crossing the river and creating the illusion for observant Confederates that they would replicate the same mistakes made in December. This move encouraged Confederates to mass their forces on the hills outside of Fredericksburg. With Confederates focused to the east, Hooker\u2019s troops completed their march around Lee. If Hooker\u2019s plan succeeded, Lee would be sandwiched between US forces to his east and west, with a river above him, and no supplies coming from below. Once across Kelly\u2019s Ford, the US troops split into two columns and raced to cross the Rapidan River at Germanna and Elys Ford. The crossing at Elys Ford is a little over 4 miles northwest of this location, up Elys Ford road. Confederates at the river crossings offered only minor resistance, but did send word to Lee about the US movements. On the morning of April 30, the Eighth Pennsylvania Cavalry was heading towards the Chancellorsville intersection from Elys Ford along Elys Ford Road, a 5-mile journey. Behind them was the rest of the US 5th Corps. Here at the Bullock\u2019s clearing, about 1 mile from Chancellorsville, they collided with the 12th Virginia Infantry in a very brief engagement from which the Virginians quickly backed away. As more US forces passed this location on their way to the Chancellorsville intersection, it became clear that Hooker successfully managed to spirit the bulk of his army around Lee. Hooker was confident, declaring to the army that day, \u201cthe operations of the last three days have determined that our enemy must either ingloriously fly, or come out from behind his defenses and give us battle on our own ground, where certain destruction awaits him.\u201d The troops that swept over the Bullock House Site at the beginning of the battle were optimistic as they marched towards the Chancellorsville intersection. That intersection would become the epicenter of US decision making over the next few days. Those optimistic US soldiers did not know how quickly and how dramatically Hooker\u2019s plan would unravel.", "callToAction": "", "callToActionUrl": "", "versions": [{"fileSize": 6739625.0, "fileType": "audio/mp3", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/nps-audiovideo/audiovideo/4b2e9850-ec8f-41e8-938e-4c615c483476.mp3"}]}

One of these swales came down the hill and passed to your right, continuing through the woods and crossing the creek to the north. While the Santa Fe Trail was primarily a trade route, use of the trail changed through time. By 1854, settlers used it to access the newly organized Kansas Territory. Settlement led to a long-term cycle of displacing indigenous populations, disrupting prairie wildlife and vegetation, and permanently imprinting the land.\u201d In the lower right corner of the panel is a small aerial photograph showing the four deepest and most visible swales, a whit arrow marking each. The trail crosses the swales in the foreground and then curves towards the distance. Text to the left of the photograph reads, \u201cFinding the Best Route.

Eleanor Stuart married Rear Admiral Victor Blue, who was a highly decorated due to his heroism in the Spanish American War, and together they spent many winters at Nelmar. Blue eventually bought the Nelmar House and then subdivided much of the island into lots offered to members of private clubs that he helped organize. Adm. Blue was the founder of the Army Navy Club which became the FG Club in 1923 (located at the Kingsley house and adjacent building). FG Club was less relaxed than RICL which he also built later to replicate other clubs he had been in.

Here General John Jones's brigade of Virginians laid in wait for the US attack, watching as a wave of blue-clad soldiers marched out of the wood line and into the field in front of you. The US battle line stretched the entire 2000 foot width of Saunders\u2019 Field, which today is about half as wide as it was in 1864, and a mile and a half south of it. As US troops moved forward, they ran into problems after the first step. Moving faster in the open field than their comrades in the woods to the south, the US battleline broke into disconnected chunks immediately. Griffin\u2019s Federal troops were left exposed to the Confederate defenders, who met them with a rain of lead and iron. At first, the attack here went relatively well for the US troops. Even though some regiments became disconnected from the units to their south, the US battle lines stayed largely intact. On both sides of the Orange Turnpike, Confederate troops gave way. General Jones\u2019s death early in the attack left the Confederate defenders south of the turnpike without a leader in a crucial moment. Troops from Gen. Charles Griffin's Union division penetrated the defenses held by Jones's and General George Steuart's Confederate brigades. However, as the Union troops gained ground, they found themselves lost and disoriented in the woods. The black powder smoke produced by soldiers' muskets was trapped by the thick woods, making it impossible to see what was happening. As US Regular Sergeant Burgess Ingersoll recalled, it became \"a weird, uncanny contest \u2013 a battle of invisibles with invisibles. Men's faces were sweaty black from biting cartridges, and a sort of grim ferocity seemed to creep into the actions and appearance of everyone within the limited range of vision.\" To make matters worse, the Confederate battleline was longer than the Federals\u2019. When the attack landed, the Confederates simply swung the longer northern part of their line down onto the US troops, outflanking and outnumbering them. As some Union soldiers fell back, others were left behind and surrounded. North of the turnpike, the 140th New York, which had been in the first wave and broken through the Confederate lines, was now trapped inside the Confederate Army and forced to fight their way back out. Here on the south of the turnpike, Alabamians counter attacked the confused and disoriented US soldiers. Some Union troops accidentally ran towards the Confederate soldiers as they tried to retreat. As they fled, many soldiers, the wounded in particular, collected in the swale, the depression that runs diagonally across Saunders\u2019 Field in front of you. While the fighting devolved into small independent struggles for survival, the woods caught fire. As the fires spread, many wounded soldiers from both sides were consumed by them. As the US forces retreated across Saunders\u2019 Field, some Confederates followed them and counterattacked. But Warren had advanced a reserve force in the trenches the US soldiers had already built, and the reserves stopped the uncoordinated Confederate counterattack cold. But the Confederates were not going to go back empty-handed if they could help it. During the assaults, two cannon from Battery D, 1st New York Artillery, advanced to support the infantry. But the guns were mostly useless. Ordered to set up in the field just south of the turnpike, the gun crews found themselves unable to aim high enough to fire directly on any Confederate positions. Instead, they fired diagonally across the field, putting the Union soldiers in just as much danger as the Confederates. When the US attack collapsed and the Confederates counter-attacked, these guns were left behind. First captured by the 1st and 3rd North Carolinian Infantry regiments, who were forced off by other Federals, the guns were captured again by the 6th Alabama. For a moment, the two Confederate units faced off, both convinced the capture of the guns were rightly theirs. They were so focused on their internal argument that the battle raging around them was forgotten, and a regiment of Federals tried to retake the guns, but the field was a no-man's land of fire and lead, and while the Confederates were driven away, the Federals were forced back themselves, leaving the guns abandoned in the field. This constant back and forth, attack and counterattack like a bloody pendulum would come to define not only the fighting at Saunders field, but the Battle of the Wilderness as a whole.", "callToAction": "", "callToActionUrl": "", "versions": [{"fileSize": 7408337.0, "fileType": "audio/mp3", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/nps-audiovideo/audiovideo/9f84aae0-293b-4de8-b645-ccff31309336.mp3"}]}

[-]October 4, 1762 Miss Adorable, By the same Token that the Bearer hereof sat up with you last night, I hereby order you to give him, as many Kisses and as many Hours of your Company after 9 O\u2019Clock as he shall please to Demand\u2026 and I presume I have good right to draw upon you for the Kisses as I have given two or three Millions at least, when one has been received, and of Consequence the Account between us is immensely in favor of your, John Adams [-]Braintree February 14, 1763 Dear Madam, Accidents are often more Friendly to us, than our own Prudence. I intended to have been at Weymouth Yesterday, but a storm prevented. Cruel, yet perhaps blessed storm! Cruel for detaining me from so much friendly, social Company, and perhaps blessed to you, or me or both, for keeping me at my distance. For every experimental philosopher knows, that the steel and the magnet or the glass and feather will not fly together with more celerity than somebody and somebody, when brought within striking distance\u2026 John Adams [-] Debbie: In the mid-eighteenth century, young people wrote lots of letters, for fun and self-improvement even if they had little of consequence to tell each other. It was common to avoid signing one\u2019s own name and to choose a name from ancient history or classical mythology. This was done not only to display one\u2019s literary attainments but also to gain \u2013 or pretend to gain \u2013 at least temporary freedom from Puritan manners and morals. Thus in some of their earliest letters Abigail and John appear as Diana and Lysander. Diana was the Roman goddess of the hunt, while Lysander was a Spartan General whose defeat of the Athenians in 404 B.C. ended the Peloponnesian War. [-]Weymouth September 12 1763 \u2026. Have you heard the News? That two Apparitions were seen one evening this week hovering about this house, which very much resembled you and a Cousin of yours. How it should ever enter into the head of an Apparition to assume a form like yours, I cannot devise. When I was told of it, I could scarcely believe it, yet I could not declare the contrary, for I did not see it, and therefore had not that demonstration which generally convinces me that you are not a Ghost. The original design of this letter was to tell you that I would next week be your fellow traveler provided I shall not be any encumbrance to you, for I have too much pride to be a clog to anybody. You are to determine that point. For your \u2013 A. Smith [-]Alan: In 1761 John Adams had inherited from his father a saltbox cottage at the foot of Penn\u2019s Hill, with the arable orchard and wood land that went with it. \u2026 By 1763 he was formally recognized by the Smiths as Abigail\u2019s husband-to-be. Fixing a time for their wedding was complicated by an outbreak of smallpox in Boston early in 1764. As a lawyer, Adams had to travel the court circuits, and so it seemed wise for him to be inoculated before establishing a household.\u201d Adams was \u201cconfined\u2019 in Boston for the month of April 1764. Abigail remained in Weymouth. May 7 and 9 saw a correspondence about Abigail\u2019s \u201cfaults.\u201d [-]Boston May 7th 1764 I promised you, sometime agone [sic], a Catalogue of your faults, imperfections, defects, or whatever you please to call them. \u2026 But I must caution you, before I proceed to recollect yourself\u2026 instead of being vexed or fretted or thrown into a passion, to resolve upon a Reformation \u2013 for this is my sincere Aim, in laying before you, this Picture of yourself. In the first place, then, give me leave to say, you have been extremely [sic] negligent in attending so little to Cards. You have very little inclination to that noble and elegant diversion\u2026 Another thing which ought to be mentioned\u2026 is, the Effect of a Country Life and Education, I mean. A certain Modesty, sensibility, Bashfulness, call it \u2026 which\u2026 you will, that enkindles Blushes forsooth at every Violation of Decency, in Company and lays a most insupportable Constraint on the freedom of Behavior\u2026 In the third place, you could never be prevailed on to learn to sing\u2026 An ear for Musick would be a source of much Pleasure, and a Voice and skill, would be a private \u2026 Amusement of great Value\u2026 In the fourth place you very often hang your head like a Bullrush. You do not sit, erected as you ought, by which Means, it happens that you appear too short for a Beauty, and the Company looses [sic] the sweet smiles of that Countenance and the bright sparkles of those Eyes. This fault is the Effect and Consequence of another, still more inexcusable in a Lady. I mean an Habit of Reading, Writing and Thinking. But both the Cause and the Effect ought to be repented and amended as soon as possible. Another fault, which seems to have been obstinately persisted in\u2026 is that of sitting with the Leggs [sic] across. This ruins the figure and the Air; this injures the Health\u2026 A sixth Imperfection is that of Walking with the Toes bending inward. This Imperfection is commonly called Parrot-toed, I think\u2026 But it gives\u2026 the reverse of a bold and noble Air, Reverse of the stately strut, and the Sublime Deportment. Thus have I given a faithful portraiture of all the Spots I have hitherto discerned\u2026 Near Three weeks I have conned and Studied for more, but more are not to be discovered. All the rest is bright and luminous. Having finished the Picture, I finish my Letter\u2026 There\u2019s a prettily turned Conclusion for You! From your --- Lysander [-] Debbie Weymouth May 9, 1764 Your brother brought your letter\u2026 I thank you for your Catalogue, but must confess I was so hardened\u2026 to read over\u2026 my Faults with as much pleasure as another person would have read their perfections\u2026 Especially may I avoid that Freedom of Behavior which according to the plan given consists in Violations of Decency, and which would render me Unfit to Herd even with the Brutes. And permit me to tell you Sir\u2026 that there is such a thing as Modesty without either hypocrisy or Formality. As to a neglect of Singing, that I acknowledge to be a Fault which if possible shall not be complained of a second time\u2026 if I had not a voice harsh as the screech of a Peacock. The Capital fault shall be rectified, tho not with any hopes of being looked upon as a Beauty\u2026 To appear in the Eyes of Lysander has been for years past, and is still the height of my Ambition. The fifth thought will endeavor to amend\u2026 but you know I think that a gentleman has no business to concern himself about the Leggs of a Lady\u2026 But I must not write more. I borrow a hint from you, therefore will not add to my faults that of a tedious letter - a fault I never yet had reason to complain of in you, for however long, they never were otherwise than agreeable to your own A. Smith [-]Alan: Sept 30th, 1764 My dear Diana, It happens very unfortunately that my Business calls me away at this Juncture for Two Weeks together\u2026Tomorrow Morning I embark for Plymouth with a disordered Stomach, a pale Face, and Aching Head, and an Anxious heart. And what Company shall I find there? Why, a Number of bawling Lawyers, drunken Squires, and impertinent and stingy Clients. \u2026 Oh my dear girl, I thank Heaven that another Fortnight will restore you to me\u2026. My soul and body have been thrown into Disorder by your Absence, and a Month\u2026 would make me the most insufferable Cynick [sic] in the World\u2026 But you who have always softened and warmed my Heart, shall restore my Benevolence as well as my Health and Tranquility of Mind. Believe me, now and ever your faithful--- Lysander", "callToAction": "", "callToActionUrl": "", "versions": [{"fileSize": 8236371.0, "fileType": "audio/mp3", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/nps-audiovideo/audiovideo/4df70edf-6b6b-4453-a92b-616155a52951.mp3"}]}

Along the Valley Pike, which is today Route 11. You should be at the interpretive marker labeled-The Union Counterattack. Face the marker and you will be looking to your west, and in the distance you will see the Alleghany Mountains. Also, looking in that direction, to your left front, amongst the trees, you will see the metal roof of the historic Miller House, which we talked about and saw at stop #7. Remember that Miller House is along the final Confederate line that afternoon, just north of Middletown and along the historic Miller Lane, today called Cougill Road. That marks the left end of the Confederate line, which was lined with heavy stone walls and made an excellent defensive position. Also, remember the Confederate line ran at least a half a mile, if not slightly longer beyond the Miller House. The right end of the Confederate line actually continued to stretch on the other side of the Valley Pike, Route 11 today, behind you, but also farther to your south, closer to Middletown which is off to your left. Also, looking to your left rear, you will see in the distance the top of Massanutten Mountain including Signal Knob. The Confederate right again stretched to the north of Middletown, on the other side of the Valley Pike and beyond where modern day interstate 81 is today. Despite the fact that many Confederates were still looting the Union camps, remember General Early the Confederate commander believes that he can wait out the Union army which is to your right a mile to your north, until nightfall and then retreat under cover of darkness. As we know, General Sheridan has returned to the battlefield, he has rallied his army, and now will begin his counterattack around 4:00 pm that afternoon. That counterattack starts and that Union lines stretching 2 miles in length. His line also stretching beyond interstate 81 where it is today and across the Valley Pike will sweep across the open ground in front of you, from your right to left, and came rolling across this ground which was much more open back then, and towards the final Confederate line. Despite being outnumbered the Confederates stood their ground and gave the Union attack a murderous fire. One Union soldier in the attack later recounted this. He said, \u201cWe got into the open fields, the rebels pouring into our faces a deadly fire from behind a stone wall. We gain a hill in the enemy front and here we halt and pour in our own fire. Of all the fires I was ever under during the war I think it was by far the hottest. The air boils and seized with mini\u00e9 balls and screeching shells and solid shot and deadly canister. All tear and plunge through our ranks. Our boys fall thick and fast.\u201d At first the Union counterattack was basically halted in its tracks. And some of the heaviest and deadliest fighting of the entire battle took place in the fields right out in front of you. What finally brought the Confederate line, broke it I should say, and drove it back was the fact that the Union right was much longer than the Confederate left and it began to overlap it at the far end of Miller Lane and began to outflank it and drive it in. And what turned the Confederate retreat, because the Confederate left began to crumble into a rout, was Union cavalry. There was an immense Union cavalry force way beyond the Confederate right and beyond the Confederate left as it was, and began to sweep in across the open fields. Some of that Union cavalry led by none other than George Armstrong Custer, who led a division of Union cavalry, came sweeping in beyond the Confederate left and turned that retreat into a panic. The Confederate left basically crumbled and the whole Confederate line, from its left to right or west to east towards you crumbled. Despite the efforts of Confederate officers, the Confederate line just began to roll up and collapse and the whole Confederate battle line just retreated, routed back towards Middletown. And the same ground they fought so hard to gain that morning was basically now lost. Through Middletown, passed Belle Grove, over Cedar Creek, through the streets of Strasburg, there was a traffic jam. Much of the spoils of war they captured that morning were now lost including all 24 guns they had captured, they lost all of those and 24 of their own. So the Union counterattack captured 48 guns during the retreat. Also, they captured, the Union army captured 1,200, one thousand two hundred prisoners. What was left of Early\u2019s army tried to rally itself at Fisher\u2019s Hill where they started the night before. The Battle of Cedar Creek would end as a tremendous Union victory. Total casualties that day for the Union army 5,700 killed, wounded, missing, including almost 600 dead. The Confederate army although not nearly as high in number were about 2,900, almost 3,000 but considering how much smaller the Confederate army was a very high percentage. This basically finished off Early\u2019s army. And what was left of it retreated southward throughout the remainder of the Valley the next day. From here on out till the end of the war, militarily, the Valley would remain under Union control, so this great Union victory that was won by Sheridan\u2019s return, literally snatching a victory out of the jaws of defeat here at Cedar Creek would put the Valley under Union control the rest of the war. Politically, this victory was important because just 2 \u00bd weeks later, the election would occur and Lincoln is able to ride the coattails of Sheridan\u2019s victory in on Election Day putting him over the top. The numbers I just rattled off to you are just statistics, but you must remember that each number is a human, a person, with a story behind it and for every soldier lost on the battlefield there is a family at home. And they are also victims of the battle of Cedar Creek. They are more than just numbers. And I think that point is driven home when you read the accounts of the survivors. One person in the 6th Corps of the Union army left a vivid account of the aftermath of this battle, and certainly drives home the impact of this battle to us today even over 150 years later. He simply wrote, \u201cThe dead and dying of the two armies at Cedar Creek were comingled. Many of the wounded had dragged themselves to the streams in search of the first want of the wounded man - water. Many mangled and loose horses were straggling over the fields, wagons and gun carriages and caissons were strewn in disorder. Abandoned ambulances sometimes filled with dead and dying were seen in large numbers. And loose teams dragged overturned vehicles over the hills and through the ravines. Dead and dying men were everywhere. Cries of agony from the suffering were heard in all directions. And the moans of wounded animals added much to the horrors of the night.\u201d", "callToAction": "", "callToActionUrl": "", "versions": [{"fileSize": 6630364.0, "fileType": "audio/mp3", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/nps-audiovideo/audiovideo/83f8869e-f348-4804-b336-7360f24c187b.mp3"}]}

It was used for flower and vegetable propagation, and it housed roses for cut flowers. The ice house stands to the right of the greenhouse, and the hemlock hedge nearby surrounds the rose garden and presidential gravesite. Just beyond the greenhouse and ice house are the stables, the coach house, and the Roosevelt family home. When the Roosevelts bought this property, vegetables and flowers were both grown in the area inside the hemlock hedge. The Roosevelts were only a family of three, but the garden continuously expanded throughout their time here, even after Franklin\u2019s father passed away and FDR was away at school. Eventually, the vegetable garden moved outside the boundary of the hedge and expanded to the area it occupies today. In 1948, the Home Garden was replaced with a parking lot for both the National Historic Site and the Presidential Library. This lot improved public access to both sites, but it did so at the cost of an important piece of Roosevelt history. The acquisition of the Bellefield property in 1975 allowed the national archives to break ground for the Visitor Center in 2001, relocating the parking lot and reestablishing the Home Garden in its original location. Demolition of the parking lot began in 2002, and groundbreaking for the Home Garden as you see it today occurred in 2015. Restoring the Home Garden remains an ongoing project as park horticulturists work to undo the soil compaction that occurred here. Although the garden is designed to replicate the Roosevelts\u2019 garden at Springwood as closely as possible, some adjustments have been made to ensure the health and accessibility of the garden, including deer fencing around its perimeter and porous pavement paths. Wherever possible, this garden contains heirloom varieties grown by the Roosevelts. However, these crops are grown using modern organic practices that may look different from what would have been here during the Roosevelts\u2019 time.

In metric, that is about 1 meter wide by a half meter tall, and about 1 meter off the ground. This exhibit is mounted on a concrete slab along a curved concrete trail. Behind the panel, are some bushes. There is a wood fence, about 3 feet or 1 meter tall, along the edge of the lawn, next to Wayne City Road. This road was historically part of the Santa Fe, Oregon, and California National Historic Trails. Across the top of the panel, is a black banner that lists the partner organizations associated with these National Historic Trails. At left, across the top of the panel, is dark text on a light blue background: On to Oregon! Many of the travelers who moved through the Kansas City area were heading for the Oregon Trail. In 1845, about 5,000 emigrants walked and rode from Missouri to Oregon. These were hopeful families seeking land and opportunity. They came by steamboat on the Missouri River. Then they made their way to town to stock up on supplies. For those who arrived at the Independence Landing, climbing this hill was the first of many challenges. Over the next 5 months, they would travel as far as 2,000 miles, or 3,219 kilometers. Many lost people, animals, and possessions along the way. Families felt both fear and excitement as they traveled the road to Independence. End of Text A color illustration of a winding trail fills the panel. This trail follows the same route as Wayne City Road. The trail is filled with wooden wagons with round cream-colored canvas tops. The wagons are pulled by either a pair of mules or a team of 4 oxen. In the foreground, at the right, are 5 people and a brown and white dog. Among them, a boy and a girl run ahead of the first wagon with their gazes forward. 2 women in pale dresses walk behind them. 1 woman wears a wide-brimmed tan hat. In the bottom center of the panel, a girl in a blue dress runs ahead of the wagon. She is looking ahead and smiling. 2 women sit at the front of the first wagon. The woman on the left is wearing a purple top and holds the reins for the mules. The woman on the right is wearing a red top. A small yellow dog sits beside her. To the left of the first wagon, is another covered wagon stopped on the side of the trail. A man and a woman tend to the front pair of yoked oxen. A third person kneels by the rear spoked wagon wheel. Similarly sized wagons follow behind along the winding trail. The dirt trail is bordered by ankle-deep green grass and meanders through a hilly green landscape. In the distance, along the horizon line, 2 steam ships are docked along a blue river. Steam billows from several buildings behind the ships. Light blue sky fills the top third of the panel. In the top right corner of the panel, is an inset map. North is toward the top of the panel. Most of the map is green. Roads are gray and the blue Missouri River curves from the top of the left side, to the right side of the top of the map. You are at the Upper Independence Landing, or Wayne City, Overlook, near the top right corner of the map. 3 trails are shown in the right, or east, half of the map: the Santa Fe Trail in yellow, the Oregon Trail in orange, and the California Trail in pink. All 3 trails continue south through the Upper Independence Landing, or Wayne City, Overlook to Independence Square, near the bottom right corner of the map. Below the map, is white text on a dark background: It was about 3.5 miles, or 5.6 kilometers, from the boat landing to Independence. The first stretch followed switchbacks up a steep hill.

In addition, a sword lines part of this row above and a musket lines part of this row on the bottom. Following is the caption and then the description of each item presented from left to right. Caption: From left: George (1776) and Martha (1772) Washington portraits by Charles Willson Peale; Washington\u2019s dress sword from the first inauguration; makeshift frying pan fashioned from a shovel; Brown Bess musket; Joseph Martin\u2019s firsthand account of his experience as a Revolutionary War soldier; Isaac Whitehead\u2019s canteen. Descriptions: The George Washington portrait is an oval miniature of him painted on ivory and framed in gold. He wears a dark blue regimental coat with gold epaulets on each shoulder. The collar and lapels appear white but are really a light tan. Under the coat, he wears a vest called a waistcoat with a thin line of gold embroidery around the neck and down the front edges. White cloth circles his neck, and a white piece of ruffled shirt peeks out from the top of his vest. A blue sash crosses over his waistcoat and under his coat on a diagonal going from his right shoulder down towards his left side. Washington's face appears like a long oval. He has white powdered hair combed back from his face and covering the tops of his ears. He looks directly at us. He has a prominent long nose, thin slight smile and a bit of a five o'clock shadow. There is nothing in the background except a light blue color.&nbsp;The Martha Washington portrait is also oval miniature, framed in a thicker and more decorative gold. She sits at a slight angle to her right, but her eyes are turned slightly left as she looks directly at us. Her brown hair is pulled back. At the top of her head is a decorative piece with a string of pearls on either side with the left side being visible only. Attached to it in the back is a longer piece of fabric. Like a ponytail, it is draped over the front of her right shoulder. Around her neck is a string of pearls. The v-line neck of her dress is bordered with a thick piece of intricate lace with a bow at the center that also has a string of pearls as a part of the bow\u2019s tie. The tones of the painting are blueish and her skin has an ivory cast. Her lips are closed with the corners slightly upturned. &nbsp;The makeshift frying pan is black with some rust. It looks like an old metal dustpan with upturned edges in between the rounded short metal handle at the top and a downward angled edge at the bottom, making it easier to shovel up or sweep something into the main flat section of the pan. &nbsp;Above the makeshift frying pan is George Washington's sword with its blade pointed slightly downward and to the right. At the top, its decorative handle includes a roundish globe called the pommel at the top. On top of the pommel is a much smaller globe, called a button. The handle has a thin metal knuckle guard which is attached to and juts out from the top and the bottom portions of the grip, where the person\u2019s hand would wrap around to hold the sword. The grip section itself has an intricate metal pattern that looks like metal string wrapped around the entire grip. The bottom part of the grip is the crossguard, which is a squat roundish piece where the person\u2019s closed hand might rest against. Underneath the crossguard is the blade, which is only partially seen as a portion of a page from a book covers the rest.&nbsp; The title page of Joseph Martin\u2019s first-hand account. At the top of the yellowing page with splotches of brown is the typed title: \u201cNarrative. Some of the adventures, dangers, and sufferings of a Revolutionary Soldier.\u201d Other text on the manuscript page is too small to read.&nbsp; A round wooden canteen shaped like a drum with flat sides has the letters \u201cI W\u201d painted on the face. A brown leather strap to carry the canteen is secured around the canteen\u2019s circumference. &nbsp; Underneath the makeshift frying pan, Martin\u2019s title page and the canteen is a Brown Bess flintlock musket. The musket is distinguished by its long English walnut stock and brass and iron furnishings. The total length of this type of musket is about five feet. The barrel length is about four and a half feet.&nbsp;", "callToAction": "", "callToActionUrl": "", "versions": [{"fileSize": 1462068.0, "fileType": "audio/mp3", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/nps-audiovideo/audiovideo/0b2b0307-3ce2-45e5-ac55-82eb2e445ebe.mp3"}]}

Similarly, t\u0131w\u00e1at (wey\u00ed\u0131letpuu doctors) drew upon their spiritual connections for healing power. When Whitman assumed the role of t\u0131w\u00e1at, he knew he had to abide by t\u0131w\u00e1at ethics, which recognized those with the power to heal also have the power to kill. The wey\u00ed\u0131letpuu penalty for malpractice was death. The night of November 28, 1847, a small group of men led by t\u00edlewkey\u02c0kt met near the mission. They discussed options to halt the spread of death and concluded Whitman was the problem. The next day, Whitman received warnings of a plan to kill him but did not react. By evening, he and Narcissa lay dead. Within days 11 more men were dead. Forty-seven other people, including children, were held hostage until December 24. Newspaper editors soon reacted: \u201cFor the barbarian murderers . . . let them be pursued with unrelenting hostility, until their lifeblood has atoned for their infamous deeds; let them be hunted as beasts of prey; let their name and race be blotted from the face of the earth, and the place that once knew them, know them no more forever.\u201d\u2014Oregon Spectator, January 20, 1848", "callToAction": "", "callToActionUrl": "", "versions": [{"fileSize": 701820.0, "fileType": "audio/mp3", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/nps-audiovideo/audiovideo/a52e25bf-5401-4248-a364-239a9da62855.mp3"}]}

Bob So let's talk about what the River was like prior to dams, just to draw the contrast.\u202f Kate This is Bob Schelly. He is a fisheries biologist for the Native Fish Ecology and Conservation Program at Grand Canyon. Bob So the Colorado River, which is a big desert river draining pretty arid landscapes. Pre-dam is characterized by really large snowmelt-driven spring runoff events and so it was typical in a spring runoff to see flows through Grand Canyon in excess of 120,000 CFS, so that's a cubic feet per second\u2026 Kate A cubic foot is about the size of a basketball. So imagine 120,000 basketballs flooding past you every second. Bob So you have these big sediment-laden spring floods and then during the summer the river levels would drop to comparatively low base flows of 5000 CFS or less. And in addition, those floods would carry lots of driftwood, woody debris, they would build enormous sandbars and create backwater habitats related to the deposition of sediment and there would be a temperature difference. You have very warm water in summer and\u202fof course in winter at base flows, the coldest temperatures, close to freezing. Kate A flood that big was like flushing the toilet, a big whoosh down the canyon...It purged things, but also brought nutrients into the canyon body... It was like a seasonal detox. Bob \u202fPost-dam pretty much all those details have changed. So now the reservoir upstream, Lake Powell, behind Glen Canyon Glen Canyon Dam, captures big spring runoff so you don't see a pulse. So it's in effect it's flattened that hydrograph.\u202fYou no longer have the big floods through the Grand Canyon, and the base flows don\u2019t get as low as they did historically.\u202f\u202f Kate The canyon used to have a pulse, a heartbeat that ran with the seasons. The dam flatlined that pulse....if the river is the heart of the canyon, the dam changed how that heart beats.\u202f \u202f Bob But you see more daily fluctuations because the dam is generating power and at peak power demand they increase the release. So over a 24-hour cycle, you see rise and fall of the River, which in the in the years right after dam closure, was quite extreme.\u202f\u202f Kate And it was extreme for humans too.\u202fThere are people on the river in Grand Canyon, floating on rafts and kayaks, navigating rapids all the time!\u202fAt night, they\u202ftie in\u202ftheir\u202fboats,\u202fbig enough to carry 15 people,\u202fto\u202fstakes\u202fon the beach\u202fand settle in to sleep to the sound of the river.\u202f Bob You hear stories about people boating through Grand Canyon and waking up after a night\u2019s sleep and finding their enormous S-rig 10 feet up on the beach, just stranded. These days that daily fluctuation is less. It might be on the order of 1 1/2 or two feet but you have daily fluctuations and a more constant hydrograph throughout the year. And it's a cold clear release because it comes out of the bottom of the reservoir, so in summer now the river is very cold which didn't used to be the case, and in winter the water is actually warmer than it would have been pre-dam Kate The River is so cold, it's really hard to swim in! The changes that happened to the Colorado after the dam changed many aspects of the corridor in Grand Canyon from the size of beaches to the experience of voters to the lives of the plants and animals that depended on that watershed. So today's story goes underwater with the fish. Let's meet Rebecca Koller who has a long career at Grand Canyon, extending back over 20 years. She had her start in the vegetation program and began with fisheries in 2016. Rebecca is now the natural resource specialist for the Native Fish Ecology and Conservation Program. Rebecca So yeah in Grand Canyon originally there were eight native fish in the Grand Canyon river and six of those are endemic Kate Endemic means that creature only lives in that geographical location. So these endemic fish are special because they only live in the Colorado River watershed that's around the Canyon. \u202f Rebecca And four of them have been extirpated and two of them are now endangered.\u202f\u202f Kate Let\u2019s look at that word extirpated. It's similar to extinction in that they have disappeared, but instead of disappearing from the entire world, they've been rooted out of a local area, similar to how grizzly bears, which are on the state flag of California, are extirpated from California today. Rebecca So I might have mentioned the Colorado pikeminnow has been extirpated from the Colorado River through Grand Canyon. It does still exist I think in pretty low numbers, huh Bob, in the upper basin. Yeah, they\u2019re declining. And that was that was one of the one of the large predatory fish and the other ones that have been extirpated from Grand Canyon is the bonytail chubs, the round-tailed chubs and is that it? Yeah. And the pike minnow. Rite, rite. So and then the other two that are endangered or the humpback chub and razorback suckers. Kate Out of the eight original native fish, the humpback chub is a crowd favorite.\u202f Bob the humpback chub is special within this group in that they\u2019re long lived fish, 40 plus years, and they\u2019re, they\u2019re habitat specialists in canyon-bound regions. So pre-dam humpback chub were not widespread throughout the basin. They were found in canyon reaches that have would have big rapids and deep water within gorges that have this pool-rapid kind of morphology.\u202f Kate Within the mile-deep gorge of Grand Canyon, the river pools into eddies after going through rapids with waves taller than people. It was the perfect habitat for the humpback chub! What else is cool about the chub? When you look at it, it has a face kind of like the canyon mules. This narrow, rounded face, and above that face rise a big hump. Bob And large adults develop this weird fleshy hump that sticks out above the head and there have been a number of theories why because its not just humpback chub, it\u2019s the razorback sucker, you can tell by the name, that feature above the head that makes them deep-bodied. And the theory that I like most, and I think there is some experimental evidence to support it, so why multiple lineages evolve this feature this humpback like feature is that Colorado pikeminnow which was the one big predator prior to\u202finvasives\u202fgaining a foothold in the basin, are gape-limited. So they can't open, even though they get very big, pikeminnows can get 6 feet long, at least they did historically, physically opening their mouth is surprisingly limited for as big a fish as they are. And it turns out that humpback chub and razorback sucker, once they reach a certain size and the hump starts to develop they become invulnerable to predation. They don't fit into the mouth of pikeminnow except the very largest pikeminnow.\u202f Kate These fish evolved, especially to interact with each other, in this specific place. This doesn\u2019t happen everywhere!\u202fSo we are looking at a predator and prey relationship that went on for centuries before the river was dammed....time enough for our chub to evolve one mean hump that\u202fwas too big, and too tough for\u202fthe shark of\u202fthe Colorado\u202fto swallow!\u202f\u202fNow that the\u202fdam is here, the entire population is completely caught in the Grand Canyon between the two dams. Rebecca Sure, yeah, so as Bob mentioned earlier, the humpback chub is the largest population of that chub remaining in Grand Canyon and it's centered around the little Colorado River and it's sort of thought of as the center of the humpback chub universe.\u202fAnd so as a result of the dam operation, it was identified as a conservation measure to establish another second spawning aggregation of humpback chub within Grand Canyon, recognizing that that little Colorado River population is, you know, it's still vulnerable to catastrophic events. Say weather events, flooding or contamination or whatnot.\u202fSo, so it was identified that that was important to establish that second spawning aggregation and so I think in the 2000s or around 2000 there was a study published looking at potential other locations for translocation, other tributary locations, and in that study it was identified, three sites were identified. They identified Havasu Creek,\u202fShinumo\u202fCreek and Bright Angel Creek as potential translocation areas that would support humpback chub population. And they were looking at like water quality, temperature and then also the presence of non-natives\u202f Kate Remember this? Bob We\u2019re walking upstream in the little gorge below the barrier fall at Shinumo to our second net in a pool in a tight, dog-like turn where yesterday we saw at least four humpback chub. Hopefully, some of those fish will be in the net. Kate Between 2009-2014, a fish crew at Grand Canyon began pro-actively\u202freintroducing humpback chub to\u202fShinnumo\u202fCreek, giving\u202fthem\u202fanother home to recover from the dam.\u202f Rebecca And all indicators up to that point where that the fish were doing well, they were, they were growing and surviving in\u202fShinumo\u202fCreek. And then in 2014 there was a fire on the North Rim and subsequent flooding into that\u202fShinumo\u202fdrainage which essentially wiped out all of the all of the fish population in that Creek including the humpback chub, bluehead suckers,\u202f speckled dace and all other fish species there so, so it was, it was I think what is interesting about that whole project was again we learned that you know these populations of humpback chubs continue to be vulnerable to those catastrophic events.\u202fFortunately, we've done work in Havasu Canyon and Bright Angel. Kate When you have an endangered species like the humpback chub that only lives in a small area, a catastrophic event like a fire or flood could cause them to go extinct. In order to increase the habitat range of the humpback chub, the fisheries crew would have to tackle another problem, the fact that invasive species are outcompeting the humpback chubs in the creeks they once called home. Rebecca So we started electrofishing the entire reach of Bright Angel Creek, which is about 13 miles, in 2012. And that effort involves backpack electrofishing with crews of, you know, 6 to 10 people. Kate I met fish crew down in the backcountry at Bright Angel\u202fcampground and\u202fjoined them in\u202fthe water as they pounded in a weir that would keep\u202fnon-native trout\u202fout of the creek. Afterward, we\u202fmet back in a roundtable at the employee cabin so that we could get the scoop on\u202fnon-native\u202ffish removal. Nick Ok, my name is Nick. I've been involved with this project for quite awhile now. I forget how many years, but I guess my favorite part about this is you're in this pretty magical place. In my opinion, you're doing really good work. Work like I mentioned earlier, we're restoring these native fish or we\u2019re trying to restore their habitat. Yeah and I guess get to outreach to people and explain what we're doing and especially having those people, some of them have come and volunteered on our crew, and just, I guess over the years we've seen people with a negative outlook kind of switch to a positive outlook and we're seeing more native fish and more people that are on board with this. Mike Uh, my name is Mike. I've helped out with this project on and off since 2012, and I've also done fisheries work throughout the Colorado River with similar fish as down here. And it's just kind of cool working on this project which is, you know, it's the same goal as projects elsewhere that I've worked, with the same species, different place. And I don't know, it's just it's cool being a part of the project that has gone on for this long and is really great people working here. Ray My name is Ray. I have been a technician here for this week is my sixth season on the Bright Angel crew and what I really like about this job, in this position, is that you know, this being my sixth year, and working the last five years you actually notice a difference every year as you work down from the source all the way down the Colorado River 13 miles of electrofishing, you can see a difference in less and less nonnative fish and more and more native fish. So I think the biggest thing for me is just being able to see that difference over a period of five years. It's pretty awesome! Makes you want to keep coming back keep doing this work, and another thing is just in terms of the job, the place you get to work in the bottom of the Grand Canyon. That's pretty awesome! People you work with are pretty great, so my best friends I met on this job. And it doesn't help that my supervisor is in the room but the people you work for us agree and not just saying that 'cause he's in the room here, but I really do think that yeah, you work for great people with great people, in a great place. It's pretty awesome. Nick So I guess we're down here I the main goal is to create a habitat friendly for the humpback\u202fchub\u202fwhich\u202fhistorically lived in bright Angel Creek or at least it's assumed at least down in the River like Delta area of right Angel and there are lots of Brown and rainbow trout in it now thanks to some people back in the early 1900s stocking it who worked for the Park Service.\u202f\u202f Kate Yes, Rangers were stocking creeks in the 1920s with sport fish from Europe like brown trout and rainbow trout. There are pictures of rangers\u202fon mules slung with old milk cans full of non-native fish. In Bright Angel canyon, rangers were even operating a fish hatchery to actively stock the creek with lots of non-native\u202fbabies.\u202fThe non-natives flourished\u202fafter the dam was put in, out-competing local fish and interrupting the river food chain.\u202fToday\u2019s\u202ffisheries\u202fcrew\u202fhad\u202fa lot of work to do, or undo,\u202fin Bright Angel Creek.\u202f Nick I guess the whole goal of the project is to protect the resources within the park for future generations and unfortunately our predecessors did put nonnative fish into the creeks, but now we're restoring those native fish that are here or at least making it making the habitat available for them so they can potentially persist into the future for future generations to come experience. Ray Nick that was beautiful! Nick Thank you, Ray. Mike I guess we can talk about how the tributaries within Grand Canyon are kind of like a stronghold for the native fish. Well, could be. I guess the River is highly modified. You know Glen Canyon dam is up there releasing cold, clear water that's super unnatural for this river\u2019s historical flows and sediment load and so the tributaries are really important to the native fish for spawning and for, you know, the like rearing of younger fish and so this is like just one little piece of a larger effort to like restoring the chubs as there's other projects in another tributary or two restoring the shed. Ray Well I may not be as qualified discussed this, but just from personal observation from talking to people who have been coming to Phantom ranch for 10s of years, one observation it could be from trout removal or not but trout kind of prey on macroinvertebrates and so I think people notice more birds entering the area that are feeding upon flying insects that may be where otherwise have been consumed from trout. But now that niche has opened, more insects maybe include some more birds. Coming to think, the last Christmas bird count they got a high species richness count. Kate One of the concerns about the brown trout is they aren't just outcompeting native fish, they are eating everything in the creek, from the small native fish like speckled dace to those aquatic insects which start their lives underwater but become flying insects like caddis flies and mayflies. They are the base of the food chain for a lot of birds. One of the neat things that I've observed in my time down by Bright Angel Creek is over the past couple years, I'll never forget the first time I saw a great blue heron going through the creek and catching those little speckled dace minnows. The amazing thing is you likely would not have seen a heron there five years ago because the trout had eaten out their traditional food source. Bob I would say a benefit of trout removal is this expansion and really increasing numbers of native fish is an although some of these natives are endangered and still can't be angled in sportfish yet. I think one day that should be an ultimate goal because fish like the humpback chubs and round tail in the upper basin and maybe one day in Grand Canyon, the large native predator pikeminnow which could grow up to six feet long. I think that one day those fish could be very appealing to people to angle the native fish that evolved in this system. And for people who are trout enthusiasts I think there are plenty of places to go and fish for trout in their native range but one day I'd like to see Grand Canyon as a destination for anglers who are interested in fish diversity where it's found naturally and it would be the experience of a lifetime to catch a large pikeminnow in the Grand Canyon. For me that would be angling gold. Nick It is about 13 miles from the source all the way to the confluence of the Colorado River so it's pretty cool we get to start up in October basically starting at the source Rangel Creek actually consists of Roaring Springs and Angel Springs and we were\u202ffortunate enough to be able to shock up the entire length of Roaring Springs an Angel Springs in October and then by around February\u202fish\u202fmid January\u202fwe make it closer to the confluence and it's pretty cool because as we start up at the top at Angel Springs it's the leaves are starting to change and then throughout the season's working or wait downstream we dropped elevation chasing fall all the way down to confluence since it's kind of cool that you know we just work with the leaves as they change.\u202f Kate As I went out on my winter backcountry patrols, I would look down on a team of women and men and waiters in their hands were yellow human sized ones that they would jab into the water. Nick excited about that the description just because anytime were shocking in the stream is 2 Electro Fishers so there's\u202fa\u202fit's a backpack base that you wear and there's two of 'em\u202fso they'll be two people wearing them should have followed by netters people getting fishes or shocked up in bucket or his people bucking fish that are netted anyway long story short people when they walk past us on the trail they make the job you probably hear this joke you know once a day twice a day but at least once a day that looks like we're Ghostbusters big square backpacks watching ghosts down there nude talk with them or tell about little bit about the project and what we're doing is really good public outreach Mike I feel like\u202flike\u202fwe're walking on bowling balls. Bob What\u2019s that show? American ninja warrior. Climbing over cascades, through overhanging vegetation and climbing up over waterfalls. It's\u202fpretty arduous getting up the creek and sometimes people can slip and top their waiders and you know, need to take 5 but it's it is an adventure getting up the creek.\u202f Kate Working in fish crew requires a blend of wilderness skills and meticulous data collection. [Sound clip of collecting data with splashes and Enya playing in the background] Mike and Bob and Nick Well everyone, the whole teams in in the creek. You\u2019ve got your two shockers up front and when the whole team's down there, you say, \u201cOk, everyone ready?\u201d and then you say, \u201cOK shocking!\u201d You check your time and the shockers put their thumbs on the on the\u202fanodes\u202fbutton and we're off and any\u202fany\u202ftrout that are within like an 8 foot radius of the\u202fthe\u202fwand will be drawn into that anode ring at the end of the wand. And after, if they reached a distance from that they'll go\u2026What's the word? Techne. But they just\u202fjust\u202flike when they're knocked out. What\u2019s a scientist word for knocked out can sort of pretend to understand. OK so they\u2019re stunned once they get close enough and thankfully the creek is really clear and sometimes they might get stunned deep down or sometimes they shoot across the field but usually you can see them\u202f'cause\u202fthey got a white belly and they kind of flash and netters Test will scoop them up. Sometimes if you're in a big cloud of dace they'll just be flowing downstream like they look like leaves or something they just keep coming and coming and coming. But yeah, we're mostly just scooping every single fish we see and putting them into buckets filled with water. At least the natives get the buckets with fresh water and then next we dispatched the\u202fthe\u202ftrout and put them in the dead bucket for\u202fprocessing later. Yeah it's pretty exciting sometimes when the water is flowing pretty fast and in a group of\u202fthere's\u202ffive to eight of us in the stream and we're trying not to fall, we\u2019re slipping around and then shout and Fisher shooting like 3 legs the waters fans were trying to net fish and or like hey\u202f Kate For the past decade, fish crew would return each fall. Over time, what they found in their studies started to change. Bob So when this project was initiated in about 2012 trout both Brown and rainbow trout were the predominant fish species in the Creek and they were very dense so that over the course of a whole season more than 10,000 trout were removed whereas today we've succeeded in reducing trout by more than 95% and last winter we removed only around 300 Brown trout so that's very successful suppression effort and the other side of that coin is that we've seen a real rebound of native fish is both in numbers and in their range.\u202f Kate 10,000 trout in the creek meant buckets of non-natives lined the creek.\u202fThis is a huge success story in Grand Canyon.\u202fIn today\u2019s world, isn\u2019t good to hear about a species coming back from the brink? Now finding a non-native fish can be\u202fit\u2019s own\u202fchallenge.\u202fIt\u2019s a big deal!\u202f Ray It's pretty exciting sometimes when the water is flowing pretty fast and in a group of there's five to eight of us in the stream and we're trying not to fall. We\u2019re slipping around and then trout and fish are shooting like through our legs. The waters running fast. We\u2019re trying to net fish and or like, \u201cHey Mike!\u201d is officially over there. Gets it. Jumps, jumps across the channel, scoops up the fish! I got that trout! I got that trout! And then it's pretty exciting, and then if we're up top like around Cottonwood, we maybe we haven't seen any native fish yet and where, you know, the water is flowing super-fast and we're trying not to fall again and, you know, these trout going between our legs. We\u2019re netting. All of a sudden someone pulls up the net and there's a, there's a maybe a flannel mouth or bluehead sucker in there and we're like, \u201cYeah! first sucker of the season this is awesome and just kind of very exciting very exhilarating it's almost like it's almost like we're ghostbusting separate trout busting. Mike Trademark! Yeah, the trout are very, they're quick, so you can't. It takes awhile for you to hone in on like, just where do you stick your net when you see them? It's kind of, it's like a game almost, like tennis. I don't know, go for the head. Nick Or hockey, a lot of people who play hockey are pretty good at netting. Another thing too is with larger trout especially for entering a pool they can feel that electrical field before hand and it's often that they'll charge at us to try and break that field, so sometimes they won't actually. You have to bring you\u2019re A-game if you want to catch those trout, and that's what our goal is. Mike Yeah, the big trout are the ones we're after because we're going in during spawning season and so we want to get the big ones that are carrying the most the eggs, you know, and the ones that are going to produce a lot of offspring. And so if we catch a big trout, that's that's a big deal that we're cutting out possibly hundreds of offspring that could be, you know, raised in the creek the following year. But also getting little ones is just as important. Mike Which brings us to the end of the day. So we're removing brown trout and rainbow trout from the creek and this kind of ugly part of the creek or the project, but also kind of cool. Every trout that is removed from the stream is used for beneficial use. We don't just, a lot of other removal projects you just throw the fish along the bank or sink 'em but every single trout that we take out of the creek either goes to human consumption or to aviaries at the Hopi and Zuni reservations. And so every fish we catch we are cleaning or bagging them and we're carrying them all the way back to the bunkhouse and putting in in vacuum sealed bags and freezing 'em and the next time the helicopter comes down we send them out. Kate What makes this fish program unique is that none of the trout are wasted. Each trout is used for beneficial use for people or other animals, and this was brought about in collaboration with Grand Canyon\u2019s Traditionally Associated tribes. These are people groups that have called the canyon home for thousands of years. Many of the tribes expressed concerns about how the program was operating in a sacred space. Kate At this point, we're going to explore an oral history conducted by Paul Hirt of Arizona State University. We're going to listen to clips from his interview with Kurt Dongoske who has been involved with the Glen Canyon Dam Adaptive Management program since 1991. Kurt was the director and principal investigator for the Zuni Cultural Resource Enterprise and often represents the Zuni tribe on issues related to River management. Kurt Anyways, so when I was at Zuni in 2008, um, a Zuni religious leader came in and asked me, \u201cAre they still killing fish and the Grand Canyon?\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.I said, yeah. He said, \u201cThat\u2019s not right. They should stop that.\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, why?\u201d And he explained to me, well he explained to me this story\u2026..\u202f Clip from Zuni in the Grand Canyon film The Eastern travelers came to the Little Colorado River where the Haiyutas warned them that as they crossed, they must hold their children tight. Then in the middle of the river, they children began to turn into water creatures. Fish, turtles, frogs, and snakes. Some parents dropped there children into the water where they were lost. They mourned but when they came to the place of the Co Co they heard singing. They were the spirits of their children. Thus all aquatic life are the ancestors and kin to the Zuni People. Kurt That event: that all aquatic beings are Zuni children, are viewed as Zuni children, whether they\u2019re native or not native doesn\u2019t matter. And\u202fso\u202ffrom a Zuni perspective, you are killing these fish, you are killing Zuni children. You\u2019re killing beings that Zuni has a special relationship to.\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f Kurt I think there\u2019s a lot of, a lot of benefit that western science could take from the Zuni perspective of this sense of stewardship in the sense that the environment that you\u2019re dealing with is composed of multiple sentient beings and that your actions on that environment have consequences, long-term consequences. I think it would make scientists much more respectful of the animals they handle, how they treat them, how they deal with them, what sorts of projects they want to design.\u202f\u202f\u202f Kate Let's hear from another oral history of Leigh Kuwanwisiwma who was director of the Hopi Cultural Preservation Office for thirty years. He is the leader of the Hopi Tribe and has been involved in the Adaptive Management Plan in Grand Canyon on the river since around 1989. Leigh The big one is the electrocution of those trout. That was a big controversy initially to Hopi cause we were the only one who commented on that proposal. So our record stands that one the initial area that they were going to zap those trouts by the thousands was right at the Confluence, you know, a sacred site. A very sacred site to us. You know. And it encompasses this kind of concept of the spiritual domain. So, well, it\u2019s our finality, as I told you, it was also the beginning of our spiritual life. I one day hope to become a Cloud Person to visit all of you people. That\u2019s how we believe.\u202fSo\u202fit\u2019s the beginning of life for us. So, our [road noise]\u2013 I said to Kurt, you know how I would best explain it? Is that they kill all these fish. They\u2019re taking life away from living creatures. And Hopi, when they do their prayer feathers and prayer offerings, it\u2019s for the perpetuation of life. It\u2019s not for the end of life. Nah. So even though that proposal had a purpose, because the effect on the humpback chub, and overpopulation, you know, it just didn\u2019t sit well with me (road noise and wind noise). If they dare do that, it\u2019s going to create this aura of death. That was our argument. Rebecca As many people know, Grand Canyon is sacred to a number of native tribes in the area. And our work was, you know, it, it has significant impact to, to non-native fish in Grand Canyon and that was of concern particularly to the Zuni tribe. The work that we're doing in Bright Angel Creek which is removing the brown and rainbow trout, was of concern to the Zuni Tribe. Their, a very sacred place to them is Ribbon Falls. And so it was through lots of consultation with them and other tribes that it was decided that all, all fish that we remove from, from Bright Angel Creek or, or otherwise, will be safe for human consumption. So all of the fish that we take out of Bright Angel Creek we clean and freezer seal and then we'll take that fish and it becomes, we\u2019ll fly it out and it's available for, for others, you know to, for human consumption. We've delivered fish to Zuni as well as Hopi and Navajo. Some of the smaller fish that we remove from the creek that's not easily cleaned we\u2019ll freeze and we\u2019ll give that to tribes for their ceremonial eagles. And so we delivered fish to Zuni to their aviary, we've also delivered fish to Navajo to the zoo there. So we try you know, as much as it's feasibly possible, to, to save any of the fish that we, we take from the creek or the river and give, you know make it available for people or, or animals, other animals. So I think that's really important component of the work we do. You know there's just a lot a lot to consider when we do any kind of conservation or restoration work in Grand Canyon, and there's I think it's important to recognize the other, the tribes that hold it sacred. Kate The damage caused by Glen Canyon Dam is done. So now what do we do after the fact? How do we manage a degraded ecosystem? How do we protect the resulting endangered species and how do we do so as human beings with a respect for life? These are the negotiations we face. In December 2020, National Geographic published an article \u201cHuman Made Materials Now Equal Weight of All Life on Earth.\u201d A quote from the article reads, \u201cThe total weight of everything made by humans from concrete bridges and glass buildings, to computers and clothes is about to surpass the weight of all living things on the planet.\u201d Many theorize we are about to enter a new era, the Anthropocene, where humans are the dominant force shaping the planet. At the start of the 20th century, the mass of human created stuff weighed about 35 billion tons; today it's 1.1 trillion tons. That means every person generates more than their own body weight of manufactured stuff in one week. As countries across the world continue to develop in a global economy, over the next 20 years that stuff is predicted to double. Projects like Glen Canyon dam are exponentially growing all over the world. Creatures like the humpback chubs are being driven to the brink of extinction. Places like Grand Canyon National Park are some of the only safe havens left on earth for plants and animals, places they don't have to worry about crossing the road or having a house built in their backyard. Let's wrap up with a question we can all ask ourselves. How do you balance the stuff you need with cultivating a richer life? My name is Kate and thank you for joining us on another episode of Behind the Scenery. We gratefully acknowledge the native peoples on whose ancestral homelands we gather as well as the diverse and vibrant native communities who make their home here today.

And most people when they come to Grand Canyon National Park to visit, they immediately have questions about the geology. Today someone asked me: What's all that green rock? How would you answer that? KATE: Yeah so, that green rock is the Bright Angel Shale layer. Um...The depositional environment for the sediment, when it lays down, it has to be able to form glauconite. So glauconite is the reason that it's green, but what's interesting about that layer for a lot of people is that it's rich with fossils. And when you're hiking across it or moving across it, there's a lot of worm tracks and tunnels and you can find trilobite track fossils out there pretty regularly as well. And when you're actually on that layer and looking at it, there's often a lot of different colors that you can see because of that shallow sea depositional environment that was present. CEILI: What other questions do you get on the trail about geology? KATE: I get a lot of questions about how old things are like, how old is this rock that we're standing on? CEILI: When people ask me that I usually just tell them they're really old. And that some are older than others. Another nice answer is that the newest rocks are on the top and they are 270 million years old. And then the oldest rocks are at the very bottom and they are between 1.8 and 1.6 billion years old. So we've got a whole spectrum here. Kate, can we find any dinosaur fossils here? KATE: The layers here at Grand Canyon predate all of the dinosaurs. So on the very top layer we see some sharks and we found shark tooths and things like that, but a lot of the fossils that we find in Grand Canyon are, um, other marine life. So we have a lot of trilobite fossils. We have shell fossils. We have different plant fossils that we can find in the Canyon, like ferns. And then we also have fossilized tracks of different animals that actually predate what we currently think of reptiles. So Ceili are these the same rocks that We see at ZIon here in Grand Canyon? CEILI: Oh yeah, were you just at Zion National Park? KATE: long pause with an unconvincing \u201cyeah\u201d (both laugh) KATE: sorry, I can't even lie when it makes sense to lie. CEILI: Yeah, most people come, or a lot of people come from Zion to the North Rim. So often people are comparing their experience to their experience at Zion and it's an interesting question to answer because the rocks in Grand Canyon are completely different than the rocks that you see at Zion Canyon at Zion National Park. But the very bottom layer of the Zion Canyon rocks is the very top layer of Grand Canyon\u2019s rocks so Zion is essentially stacked on top of Grand Canyon, and that's because they're all part of the Grand Staircase, kind of geologic formation. So you can even see the full staircase from some parts of the Kaibab Plateau. Yeah, it's hard to remember common questions that people ask about geology, 'cause we've worked in the Canyon for a couple of seasons. And when people are hiking in the Canyon the questions are usually about: Where's the next water station? How do I fix my blisters? How do I hike out of here with success and how might I survive the day? But the cool thing is, all those questions do relate to geology. The geology of Grand Canyon determines every part of a hiker's day down here. Sometimes at the end of a work day at Phantom Ranch some of the Rangers find themselves on the porch eating dinner and sometimes we talk for hours about our favorite rock layers in Grand Canyon. And there's a lot of funny stories and experiences and emotions that are attached to different rock layers in Grand Canyon for different people. (Music) KATE: Inspired by these porch talks, we decided to go around and ask our coworkers and friends what is their favorite geologic layer here at Grand Canyon and why? DOUG: My name is Ranger Doug. I'm a second-year summertime seasonal ranger at the North Rim of Grand Canyon National Park. My job is to meet and greet the public, answer questions, hand out information. KATE: So my question for you is what is your favorite layer here at Grand Canyon? DOUG: Geologic layer? KATE: Geologic layer. DOUG: My favorite is the Coconino, because it's so distinctive. I can point it out to folks at our outdoor visitor centers, prominently seen there. Last night I was out at the veranda behind the North Rim Lodge watching the sunset and somebody asked where the village was and the Bright Angel Trail and you can actually see the offset of the Coconino where the Bright Angel Fault has uplifted the west side and that's kind of a landmark that I look for, for trying to find where the trail goes in and out of the Canyon as well as the, the village area just to the east of where the Coconino\u2019s been off set. So that's my favorite layer. (Music) MATTHEW: My name is Matthew Baldwin. I work in the Backcountry Office out of the Flagstaff Office, and we issue river permits and Backcountry permits and patrol the backcountry. My favorite rock layer here at Grand Canyon is going to be the Coconino Sandstone because when you're hiking out from the bottom of the Canyon means you\u2019re almost home and just those big beautiful white cliffs with the cross bedding and the sandstone. It\u2019s absolutely beautiful. So I lost my hat one time during a blizzard as I was hiking out it got blown off a cliff and it was just gone. So if you\u2019re ever near the South Kaibab Trail and you look over a cliff and happen to see a green hat, its mine, bring it back please. (Music) CEILI: How many miles of under the rim Grand Grand Canyon hiking have you done? Just so we know that like this is really the best and the worst layers. JEN: Overall, or at one time? CEILI: Yeah, just whatever number you have. JEN: It would be impossible to say how many, um, if I had to estimate, it's probably upwards of probably in the 20,000 range. Well, the Esplanade is an easy favorite for so many reasons. It just feels like a different planet really. (Background radio noise \u201cDispatch, Canyon 20\u201d) You know, like it really I feel like paints an amazing picture of the people who lived here before us because it was a very common layer for them to live in. You know, much like the Tapeats, but yeah, the Esplanade\u2019s got so much history and just so much beauty. And it's really like nothing else in the Canyon. Maybe somewhat comparable to parts of the Supai. You can get some sections of the Supai, particularly at its ends that are very, very similar, but uh, the Esplanade is just amazing to me. It just feels like walking on Mars like just a whole untouched planet. CEILI: And is it like also because it's easy to walk on like is that, is that part of it you think? JEN: Actually, it's really not easy at all. It's actually a lot of switch levels, switch leveling and upping and Downing. And you know one of the challenges of the Esplanade is that you know there's a ton of cryptobiotic soil and can be very difficult to avoid the crypto. Like very difficult, yeah. So it gets very tedious. Now if you don't care about cryptobiotic soil \u2013 yes it would be easy walking, but if you're you know, protecting the Canyon as we all do, it's a lot of sidestepping and rerouting and switch leveling and then like you might be going on a level and it gives out and now you have to like scramble up slickrock which can be challenges as well. (Music) MICHAEL: Yeah, my name is Michael Wichman. I'm a backcountry guide for the Wildland Trekking company. I've been doing so for going on 13 years now. Worked for a couple other companies as well, but Wildlands is my primary gig. I often say that this is a difficult place to have favorites in because every layers got their own story to tell with different chapters at each, uh different location that they appear in the Grand Canyon. Uhm, off the top of my head. I typically say the Redwall Limestone's my favorite layer for several reasons, one, it has the most karst like systems in it. The most caves. Limestone is very porous, and water tends to percolate through it and so we get beautiful cave structures. The condors tend to like to roost in those caves. Laying their eggs there with the fledging - fledglings, first flight coming off the huge Redwall Limestone. It can be 1000 feet thick at times in certain places. Also, most of the water features tend to, like the waterfalls and such, tend to occur at the bottom of the Redwall, when the water that seeps through tends to hit the impermeable shale, Bright Angel Shale below it. So I love the Redwall. My other thought as I was talking about this is the...If I get to pick 2. The Chuar formation over up in the Lava Chuar Canyon area, kind of by Unkar Delta further upriver than here. It gets really beautiful. Teals and turquoise like beautiful wavy U-shaped features in it. And it's a more unusual layer that you only see in that area. So I've only ever seen it on a couple few river trips and by foot only twice. Once my partner and I, we hiked from Nankoweap to Phantom off route and that was one of the highlights of that trip. The Redwall for its commonality, or how often you see it, and so every time that we're out here guiding or hiking personally. You're almost always going through the Redwall. And so it's fun to see the different ways that it takes shape and the different members of it. Seeing the coral bed fossils and whatnot inside it. So it's nice to see the Redwall as often as we see it. JESSE: My name is Jesse Barden. I am the North Rim interpretation seasonal supervisor and I've been at the Canyon for like 6 years now. But the ones, the ones that stand out to me the most are the Redwall and the Muav limestone layers. They're kind of stacked right on top of each other, and I think they're just like they, they do the coolest things. They have all the cool caves. They have all the cool slot canyons. The Muav has all the flowing water, not all of the flowing water, but most of the major springs comes out of the Muav. Yeah, they're both just so excellent. A memory of a route through the Redwall. It's called the Red Slide Route, and it's probably the first like really challenging off trail route that I've done in the Canyon and me and my friend Darrin, we're on a river trip, you know, and he and I decided to do this canyoneering route. Down in Western Grand Canyon. And so we climbed up the Red Slide Route to get to the canyon and the route description was only a few sentences. And it said, you know, look for these things. You'll find some hoodoos. It's a little bit scrambly. Made no mention of the 5th class climbing that we'd have to do on the way up, so we started our trip at about 6:00 in the morning. In the dark, it was January, so it was pretty dark for a while. And we made our way slowly up this really steep slope and it's all like crumbly rocks barely held together. Like kind of like Pebble sized it seemed like and so many, many of the points going up the first bit we were on all fours, like using our hands, using our feet. And then we get to the top of this big kind of debris cone, and we're just sort of looking around and looking at each other. Like trying to figure out where the route goes, 'cause we're really just hoping that we don't have to go up the 15 foot vertical cliff that's right in front of us and then Darrin spots a cairn at the top of that Cliff and we\u2019re like ughh, guess we have to go up there. (laughter) And so, yeah, there ended up being three or four of those kinds of like short, fairly easy climbing, but like unprotected and fairly high consequence like cliff bands that we had to navigate with heavy packs and it was a tremendous relief when we finally got through that Redwall section into the Supai where the walking is pretty easy. (Music) JEFF: I'm Jeff Caton and I'm one of the lead interpreters on the North Rim. JESSE: You\u2019re the lead interpreter on the North Rim. JEFF: I am the lead interpreter. Yes, the only one. My favorite geologic layer is the Bright Angel Shale for a couple silly reasons. One reason is I like the way it sounds when it crunches under my boots. A weird, a weird reason, but I like the way it sounds. Another reason is when it was the second time I came to the Grand Canyon backpacking trip that went not terribly wrong, but pretty wrong. I got sick. I ignored everything the Ranger said, like I went out of my way to just check off like and not do what the Ranger said not do. And I woke up and I was sick and this isn't good and I remember the sound of it under my boots. I stopped maybe at Salt Creek, so I stopped somewhere for the hot part of the day. And then about three or four, I started hiking again. There were a few clouds, and I promptly started throwing up so I remember that the sound of the Bright Angel under my boots. And kneeling on it to puke several times. (Music) ELYSSA: My name is Elyssa Shalla and I'm a Park Ranger here at Grand Canyon. My favorite geologic layer is by far the Tapeats Sandstone. I think it, just being able to look at and touch and see all of those sediments in that layer gives you the opportunity to really kind of transform yourself back in time and think about all the different ancient landscapes that the Canyon has been through throughout its lifespan. When I think of the Tapeats, I think of all of the years that I worked down at Indian Garden as a Ranger and all of the times we went down into the Tapeats Narrows. You know getting to talk with people, people that were just excited to be down there. Some people that were struggling to get through that section and up to the Indian Garden campground. I think it's, it's packed with beauty and suffering. (Music) KATE: Behind the Scenery is brought to you by the interpretation team at Grand Canyon National Park.
