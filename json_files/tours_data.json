Welcome to Fort McHenry National Monument and Historic Shrine, birthplace of the National Anthem! On this tour you will learn the War of 1812 story of Fort McHenry and how the battles, stories, and people, made Baltimore the ORIGINAL \u201cHome of the Brave.\u201d\nBefore we begin, you should know that this tour does lead you into the Star Fort Historic Zone, which is a fee collection area, so if you haven\u2019t paid for access to the fort you should head back to our visitor center, or purchase a Fort McHenry day pass or annual pass by going to recreation.gov on your phone. \n\nAs you begin this tour, reference the large concrete map before you as you learn how it is that Baltimore becomes the focal point of the War of 1812.\n\n On Thursday, June 18, 1812 President James Madison signed a Declaration of War against Great Britain. Many residents in Maryland, especially those in Baltimore\u2014the 3rd largest city in the country as well as one of the nation\u2019s leading ports--welcomed the news. Trade in the port of Baltimore had been greatly curtailed since the trade embargos with Great Britain and France enacted by Presidents Jefferson and Madison. During the rest of 1812 and into 1813, trade boomed in Baltimore. This was helped by the growing list of private ships went out to seize British merchant ships. They would confiscate the cargo and return to port to auction off whatever had been seized, keeping the profits. These privateers had an easy time of it until March of 1813. It was at this time that a fleet of British warships commanded by Rear Admiral George Cockburn sailed into the Chesapeake Bay. \n\nCapturing Baltimore privateers coming down the bay, Admiral Cockburn also proceeded to attack small towns along the Maryland\u2019s eastern shore. The towns of Georgetown and Havre de Grace were attacked and burned. St. Michaels was attacked twice but managed to keep the British from entering the town. In April of that year, Cockburn sailed up the Patapsco within sight of Fort McHenry but did not attack.\n\nIn the spring of 1814, new admiral in charge of the British operations the Chesapeake, Alexander Cochrane issued a proclamation that all enslaved people in the Chesapeake region could gain their freedom by serving in the British forces against the United States. American fears of a slave insurrection grew, and more horror would come as 5,000 British regulars would enter the region having recently been freed up by defeating Napoleon. 1814 was a year of fear and horror for the people of Maryland as British raids and burnings increased, which eventually lead British forces up the Patuxent river trapping a small force of American ships close to its headwaters leading to Washington D.C., from which they began moving towards the nation\u2019s capital. \n\nOn August 24, they roundly defeated American forces at the Battle of Bladensburg, clearing the way for an assault on Washington that evening. The British marched down Maryland Avenue through the heart of the city to burn the Capitol building, and then headed down Pennsylvania Avenue to burn the White House. \n\nBy mid-September, the British fleet had advanced to the Patapsco River where about 4,500 British troops landed at North Point and began an 11-mile march to Baltimore. As the land troops made their way toward the city, British warships moved up the Patapsco River toward Fort McHenry and the other defenses around the entrance to Baltimore Harbor.\u201d", "audioFileUrl": "https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/954F118C-CA3E-93EB-9A4F0B2EEA9973B3.mp3"}, {"significance": "Learn about some of the support structures that would have been located outside of the Star Fort structure.", "assetId": "9DFA2250-4CAE-470E-A34F-0775AC2B20D9", "assetName": "Brick Foundations", "assetType": "places", "id": "957C4A26-DF04-2818-34505E2D5AC6B0E7", "ordinal": "2", "directionsToNextStop": "Continue up the path towards the Star Fort, stopping when you immediately enter the wooden fenced area, facing the for cannon on the left.", "audioTranscript": "\u201cNotice the areas of brick to the left and right of the pathway. These brick rectangles represent foundations of buildings that would have been here during the War of 1812.\n\nThe first brick building outline was the Quartermaster & Ordnance Storehouse, which was approximately 100 feet long and had four rooms on the ground floor. The building was used for storage of quartermaster supplies (brooms, buckets, clothing, etc.), and to house a carpenter shop, a leather working shop and a gun shed where field guns and implements were placed to keep them out of the weather. The second floor had usable storage and workspace.\nThe next brick building outline, further up the path was the Ordnance/Commissary Storehouse, which was 75 feet long, and slightly wider than the first. It had three rooms on the ground floor (two in front and single long room in the rear). One room in front was used for the storage of ordnance stores, implements, tackle and rope for the great gun; the other room in front was used as a stable for officer\u2019s horses. The long room in the rear was used for subsistence stores (food) and was there that rations were drawn.\nThe hospital was about 30 yards further and on the right of the road. It was a brick, two-and-a-half story building similar in size and construction to the commander\u2019s quarters, but the fireplaces were on the ends. The hospital had its own kitchen, examination room, operating room, and two wards, one upstairs and the other on the first floor. \n\nFrom the hospital, the road ran along the post boundary to the wharf at the Patapsco River, where the Baltimore City fire boats are docked today. Along the right side of the road were several sheds and wooden buildings, as well as outside work areas, of which nothing remains today, but in 1814 played a significant part in the daily life of the garrison.\n\nThe post hospital at Fort McHenry was under the charge of Dr. William Stewart, Hospital Surgeon's Mate, U.S. Army Medical Department, 10th Military District. Dr. Stewart was authorized to employ four civilian medical staff: a matron and three nurses. The matron received $6 per month, plus daily rations, fuel and bedding straw, while the nurses received $5 per month, plus daily rations, fuel and bedding straw. For those not familiar with military organization, the 10th district was the command one level above Major Armistead. Oversight of hospital personnel was the direct responsibility of Dr. Stewart. Dr. Stewart also employed a civilian cook at the hospital. The hospital cook received $5 per month, plus daily rations, fuel and bedding straw.\n\nlooking up towards the main fort structure there would have been another structure just outside of where the wooden fence is today. This was a brick tavern owned by the Schwartzhouer family. Bricks in the grass indicate the corners of the tavern building. Across the road was a barn belonging to the establishment. The Army took over the structures under lease in 1821 and purchased the entire property in 1831. All of these buildings were important support structures to make Fort McHenry a livable place for soldiers stationed here to protect Baltimore\u2019s harbor.", "audioFileUrl": "https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/9566DC8E-FABD-352F-FAE3A22D685B87D8.mp3"}, {"significance": "Learn about the water batteries that were constructed along the banks of the peninsula to help reinforce Fort McHenry's defense.", "assetId": "C202D806-4B89-4784-866E-6FA46948BA8D", "assetName": "Water Battery", "assetType": "places", "id": "9590A584-080B-79BB-5DBAAD4FADCCBCE9", "ordinal": "3", "directionsToNextStop": "Continue inside of the Star Fort structure, going to the first large building on your left.", "audioTranscript": "Quick reminder: if you haven\u2019t purchased your Fort McHenry day pass or annual pass you are not permitted access to the fort.

Thank you.\n\nThe earth mounds with 4 cannon on a wooden deck in front of you are reconstructed to represent the water batteries which were the main defenses at Fort McHenry that were located outside of the star fort itself. Under the direction of Captain Samuel Babcock, U.S. Army Engineers, civilian laborers, along with members of the First Marine Artillery of the Union, worked throughout the summer of 1813 on improving the Upper and Lower Water Batteries and mounting 18- and 36-pounder naval guns. \n\nAbout 150 feet up the hill from the southeast edge of the Parade Ground was the Upper Water Battery, also known as the \u201cOld Battery.\u201d This was a J-shaped earthwork originally built in 1776 as part of the works at Fort Whetston. In 1813 the works were improved under the direction of Captain Samuel Babcock, U.S. Army Engineers. The battery initially mounted six guns of 18- and 36-pounder size, with at least three more added prior to the battle in 1814.\n\nMagazines were used to hold and protect ammunition, particularly powder and slow match. A 10\u2019 x 20\u2019 brick magazine was located to the rear and just to the left center of the battery. A second, larger (20\u2019 x 20\u2019) magazine was built next to the first, but it is unclear if this was before or after the battle. \n\nThe  Lower Water Battery (located in the Northeast Section) was also dated from 1776. In the summer of 1813, the parapet was rebuilt and extended around the south point of the fort in order to cover the Middle Branch of the Patapsco River. While the parapet was continuous, the guns were mounted in three sections. The Northeastern Section was located just below the Upper Water Battery This section was shaped in a zig-zag fashion. It had a wooden platform and mounted eleven 36-pounder guns. \n\nBrick hotshot furnaces were located at both the upper and lower water batteries. These ovens would heat solid shot cannonballs with the intention of making them able to not only hit British ships, but also set them ablaze. \n\nReference the near by park signage or your park brochure which show a painting depicting the bombardment of Fort McHenry to see the full design of these water battery defenses.\n\nIt would be these guns that were most important to keeping the British ships at bay during the bombardment on September 13-14, 1814.  When the British ships fired upon the fort, they did so from a distance of approximately two miles offshore. The American guns from these batteries only had a range of a mile and a half making them obsolete during most of the battle, though they could keep the British vessels from landing on shore or entering the harbor.", "audioFileUrl": "https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/957F3A7F-FB56-E7BF-FA6B4290AD55B9AC.mp3"}, {"significance": "The barracks were the buildings that soldiers lived in at Fort McHenry.

This room represents how soldiers would have lived in these buildings during the War of 1812.\n\nAt the beginning of the War of 1812, men who enlisted in the Regular Army had a five-year commitment, and while most of the men who enlisted were between the ages of 18 and 35, there were a considerable number of men who served that were in their 50s and 60s as well. In 1812, Privates were paid $5 a month. In addition, every soldier received a bounty of $31 and 160 acres of land. However, because enlistments fell far short of requirements, Congress gradually increased the incentives so that by the end of 1813, recruits were enlisting for the duration of the war rather than five-years, pay was increased by $3 per month to $8, and the bounty was raised to $124 and 320 acres of land. \n\nThroughout the year, the soldiers at Fort McHenry arose at 5:30 A.M. to the sounds of reveille played by the fifes and drums. Bed sacks were doubled to the head of the bunks, with the blankets doubled from the length, turned together in three folds, and laid on top. The rooms were then swept clean, so that no straw or litter was left under the bunks or in the corners.\n\nHalf an hour after reveille, the assembly was sounded, and every man, except the sick, and those already on duty, formed on the parade and the roll was called by the first sergeant. The officer of the day inspected the parade, while the quartermaster went through the barrack-rooms, to ensure that they were clean, in good order, and that every man was turned out. The men were then dismissed back to their barracks, while the first sergeant proceeded to the adjutant's room with his morning report. \n\nA few minutes before breakfast, the sergeants went through the rooms to see that every man was present and that the tables were properly placed, with the utensils laid out ready for the sound of the breakfast call. The bedding was then taken out, (weather permitting), and left to air in whatever place was most convenient for the purpose. This was done under the direction of the quartermaster, who insured that the passages and avenues about the garrison were kept thoroughly clean. The men then employed themselves in getting ready for guard duty or parade.\n\nAt about eight o'clock, the fort's commander made his first round of the quarters, guard house, and hospital, attending to the general good order and cleanliness of the garrison. Junior officers were to be in readiness to attend the commander, should he require them to do so. \n\nThe general morning parade was, in the summer season, held at nine, and in the winter, at ten o'clock. At three quarters of an hour before all general parades, musicians call was sounded by the duty drummer \u2014 at this time, the non-commissioned officers and musicians turned out for inspection by the officer of the day. At the call for morning parade, all the men were formed, and the junior officers inspected their men. \n\nMen selected for fatigue duty and those reporting for sick call were formed separately under their respective non-commissioned officers. The captain then proceeds to size the company, with the shortest man in the center and the tallest men on the flanks and organize it into four sections. The captain then marched his company to the place designated for the morning drill and maneuvered his men for two or three hours.\n\nAt noon, the men were marched back to their barracks and were given one hour for lunch. In the afternoon the men were reformed for artillery drill. Three-quarters of an hour before the general evening parade, all the troops were assembled by the officer of the day for inspection. The men were then allowed to stack arms and walk about freely until the sounding of assembly. In the summer this was at half past five o'clock, and in the winter at four o'clock.\n\nDinner call sounded at six-thirty after which the men could lark, sing, play games, and discuss the rumors of the day. At ten the drums and fifes played tattoo; at which time, letters were finished, the last song was sung, and the games put away. At half past ten taps were sounded, and the lights were put out.\n\nOn Sunday, church parade followed the morning parade, after which the Articles of War were read. At mid-day a general dress parade was held, with the remainder of the day at the disposal of the men, \"and it was hoped that no abuse would be made of the indulgence.", "audioFileUrl": "https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/9594848D-9A53-EF92-0CEBBBE5BC0B8078.mp3"}, {"significance": "From Bastion 5 you can see the point of British attack.

At Hampstead Hill, the city\u2019s main defense, the British faced over 60 cannons and between 15-18 thousand men within well-constructed earthworks.\n\nTo take Baltimore the British navy would have to sail into Baltimore to assist the army\u2019s attack on the city.\n\nEarly in the morning of September 13, 1814, 17 ships of the British navy sailed up the Patapsco river heading for Baltimore, the third largest city in the United States.\n\nThe main defense along the Patapsco was Fort McHenry. Located on a peninsula two miles from the city, the fort covered the water approaches to the northeast and northwest of the city\nTo the northwest, in the Ferry Branch of the river, were three small forts, Battery Babcock, Forts Covington and Lookout.\nAt Fort McHenry, commanded by Major George Armistead of the U.S. Corps of Artillery, were over 1000 defenders made up of U.S. Army regulars and state militia. With 23 cannons in the fort and 20 on the water battery Fort McHenry could sink any ship within of a range mile and a half.\n\nTo the east, in the Northeast Branch, across the river from Fort McHenry was the 3-gun Lazzaretto Battery, manned by the Chesapeake flotilla.\n\nIn the channel, a line of merchant ships was sunk to obstruct the entry into Baltimore. Behind the sunken ships were 11 gun barges the size of large rowboats, each had a cannon in the bow and one in the stern. Across the narrow channel was also a boom chain in front of the sunken ships.  \n\nAt 6 o\u2019clock in the morning of the 13th, The British ships under the command of Admiral Cochrane approached Fort McHenry. \nThe five bomb ships, with names designed to inspire fear, HMS AETNA, DEVESTATION, METEOR, TERROR and VOLCANO, capable of firing a mortar shell two miles, and the rocket ship EREBUS, began the bombardment of the fort at 6:30 a.m. During the next 25 hours, under a heavy rainstorm for most of the time, 15-18 hundred bombs and rockets would be fired at the fort.\n\nWatching the bombardment aboard a Baltimore packet ship, leased as a truce vessel, was Francis Scott Key. Key was a local lawyer who had been sent by the United States Government to negotiate the release of a U.S. citizen who had been taken prisoner by British forces, a Dr. William Beanes. Although Key was successful in negotiating for the release of Dr. Beanes, British leadership realized he might have overheard plans for the attack on Baltimore, so Key\u2019s ship was detained from leaving the British fleet until the battle was over.

Stationed in the dry moat were the 38th, 36th, 14th and 12th U.S. Infantry units, a total of 600 US Regulars, sheltering from the bombardment.\n\nThe name William Williams is listed with the names of other recruits on the muster roll of the 38th U.S. Infantry. It seems like any other name, but this name is an alias, a name made up to protect the identity of a young Marylander escaping slavery by joining the United States Army. Federal law at the time said that enslaved persons could not join the army because they \"could make no valid contract with the government\" and it was often necessary for freedom seekers (those escaping slavery to obtain the basic human right of freedom) to create new identities in order to get jobs of any kind.\n\n\u201cWilliams\u201d was the name used by Frederick Hall, or a man who \u201csometimes calls himself Frederick Hall,\u201d according to an escaped slave ad placed in the newspaper with a Forty Dollar Reward by Benjamin Oden. Hall was 21 when he sought his freedom from slavery in Prince Georges County and enlisted on April 14, 1814.\nHall was enlisted as a private in the U.S. Army and was assigned to the 38th U.S. Infantry Regiment. The officer who enlisted William Williams did not question him. Perhaps, William (or Frederick) was able to pass, or move within white society as a white person in order to survive. The newspaper ad posted by Benjamin Oden describes Hall as \"a bright mulatto and so fare, as to show freckles,\" which may mean that he was a light-skinned man. Perhaps the officer was in desperate need of soldiers and looked the other way. Maybe the officer was a man who did not believe in slavery or even wanted to help freedom seekers. Whatever the case, Williams received his enlistment bounty of $50 and was paid a private's wage of $8 per month.\n\nIn early September 1814, the 38th U.S. Infantry was ordered to march to Fort McHenry. During the bombardment, Williams would have been sheltering with his regiment on the opposite side of fort wall behind this building. A month after the battle Williams entered the hospital with tuberculosis, dying from disease during his service in March of 1815.\n\nWilliams was not the only black man to serve in the armed services during the War of 1812. There are numerous records of black sailors. George Roberts, a free black, served on the privateers Chasseur (\"Pride of Baltimore\") and Sarah Ann. Charles Ball was a Seaman in Commodore Joshua Barney's U.S. Chesapeake Flotilla who later published his memoirs in 1836.", "audioFileUrl": "https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/95E30B23-B8FB-CA89-0860855521A700F2.mp3"}, {"significance": "The location of where the original Star-Spangled Banner flag flew during the bombardment of Fort McHenry, the site of which inspired Francis Scott Key to write our modern day National Anthem.", "assetId": "0E09F586-2497-4099-99F8-B944E3955546", "assetName": "Flag Pole", "assetType": "places", "id": "96354C4F-90EA-8097-433421399BF27C08", "ordinal": "9", "directionsToNextStop": "Exit the Star Fort Historic Zone following the path back down towards the visitor center.

Not knowing for sure when an attack would occur, they spent months preparing for it. Everything was made ready at Fort McHenry to defend Baltimore.\nMajor George Armistead, the Fort\u2019s commanding officer, desired \"to have a flag so large that the British will have no difficulty in seeing it from a distance.\"\n\nIn the summer of 1813, Armistead ordered a large garrison flag (30 feet by 42 feet) as well as with a smaller storm flag (17 feet by 25 feet) for the Fort. The job went out to a 37-year-old widow, Mary Pickersgill, a ship and signal flag maker. She labored for seven weeks with her 13-year-old daughter, Caroline, two nieces, 13-year-old Eliza Young and 15-year-old Margaret Young, a 13-year-old African-American indentured servant, Grace Wisher, and possibly her mother, Rebecca Young, who had taught her the trade. They pieced together strips of loosely woven English wool bunting then laid the whole flag out on the expansive floor of a brewery near Mrs. Pickersgill\u2019s Pratt Street house, now the Star-Spangled Banner House museum. The flags were finished on August 19, 1813.\n\nThe larger of the two flags had stripes two feet wide, and stars 24 inches from point to point. At that time, it was the practice to add one star and stripe for each new state joining the Union. In 1814, the United States flag had 15 stars and 15 stripes.\n\nThroughout the night of the bombardment the smaller 17x25 foot storm flag flew over the fort. The next morning after the British ships had stopped firing and the smoke and fog cleared, Major Armistead ordered the flag lowered replaced by the much larger 30x42 foot garrison flag. Offshore looking anxiously towards the fort, Francis Scott Key waited for a sign of who had won the battle. The site of the massive garrison flag being raised over the fort inspired him to write the words to \"The Star-Spangled Banner,\" our modern-day National Anthem. Today this flag is displayed in the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History, Washington, D.C. The smaller storm flag, which was the flag that flew during the rainy bombardment, has been lost to history.", "audioFileUrl": "https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/961EDCB4-0715-9649-854E37712C178758.mp3"}, {"significance": "The monument dedicated to Major George Armistead, commander of the defense of Fort McHenry.", "assetId": "5F4CC3A0-B995-45D4-8898-A6547BC5A5C8", "assetName": "Armistead Plaza", "assetType": "places", "id": "964621D8-9E0B-EAAF-6C1CC8530BC5F456", "ordinal": "10", "directionsToNextStop": "continue along the side walk path taking the first path that turns to the left that you come to.

On his taking command of Fort McHenry in June 1813, Armistead ordered a flag made \"so large that the British will have no difficulty in seeing it from a distance.\" He earned his enduring place in American history under that flag at Fort McHenry whose stalwart defense of Baltimore against British attack in 1814 inspired Francis Scott Key to write \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\" Armistead remained in command of the fort until his untimely death at age 38 on April 25, 1818. He is buried in Old St. Paul's Cemetery, Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nThis statue was dedicated to Major Armistead for the centennial anniversary of the battle in 1914 and has been moved several times before ending up in this spot in 2010.", "audioFileUrl": "https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/9637A016-DCFE-DECC-311CF2219EA00749.mp3"}, {"significance": "Dedicated to Francis Scott Key and the defenders of Baltimore, learn how the memory of the War of 1812 and the Star-Spangled Banner were being recognized by the government before even being made into the National Anthem.", "assetId": "C6A3E637-977E-48BA-AC7C-CDC4AD7A428C", "assetName": "Orpheus Statue", "assetType": "places", "id": "96557445-9584-94A3-5CC5F353F513FBDE", "ordinal": "11", "directionsToNextStop": "", "audioTranscript": "Many visitors to the Fort wonder why there is a statue of Orpheus, the Greek mythological hero of music and poetry, at the park. This classical monument is dedicated to Francis Scott Key and the soldiers and sailors who took part in the Battle of North Point and the defense of Fort McHenry during the War of 1812.\n\nIn 1914, Congress appropriated $75,000 for a monument at Fort McHenry to mark the centennial of the writing of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d and the defense of Baltimore. A national competition was held by the \u201cFine Arts Commission\u201d on May 28, 1916. One of the 34 entries was a design by Charles H. Niehaus. His work, called Orpheus with the Awkward Foot was chosen.\n\nThere was a delay erecting the statue due to World War I. Finally, the statue was completed, and a dedication was held on Flag Day, June 14, 1922. The ceremony was attended by President Warren G. Harding.The statue was originally placed in the middle of the entrance road with a circular drive around it. In 1962, Orpheus was relocated to the present site.\n\nThe monument consists of a 15-foot high circular base made of white marble. Decorated with a frieze in low relief, the base is surmounted by a 24-foot high figure of Orpheus in bronze, shown playing a five-stringed tortoise-shell lyre. The frieze starts with a portrait shield of Key and the dedication, then continues around the drum of the base with a representation of the classic muses paying honor to the army and navy.\n\nThe marble base bears a medallion honoring Francis Scott Key, flanked by a procession of allegorical figures. The pedestal contains a time capsule filled with documents of patriotic and historical interest. Although the time capsule was opened in 1962, there are no plans to open it in the future.\n\nThe inscription on the base reads:\n\nTo Francis Scott Key - Author of the Star-Spangled Banner and to the soldiers and sailors who took part in the Battle of North Point and the defense of Fort McHenry in the War of 1812.", "audioFileUrl": "https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/9647FAB7-E4CC-C1FB-CEA6E49C7AA0E1B3.mp3"}], "images": [{"credit": "NPS/Tim Ervin", "crops": [{"aspectRatio": 1.78, "url": "https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/primary/952DA944-A26F-FE8A-7998B0A616F57A08.jpg"}, {"aspectRatio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/secondary/952DA944-A26F-FE8A-7998B0A616F57A08.jpg"}], "title": "1812 tour photo", "altText": "Two living historians in 1812 gear posing in front of the large garrison flag.", "caption": "Living historians dressed as War of 1812 soldiers.", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/952DA944-A26F-FE8A-7998B0A616F57A08.jpg"}]}

The fee can be paid either online at recreation.gov, or in the park visitor center. Thank you.\n\nThe American Civil War proved to be the greatest test to the \u201cland of the free.\u201d The institution of slavery by 1861 had grown to its greatest prominence, with 4 million people in bondage, primarily in the American South. The divisive issue of slavery had many moments of high tension that eventually boiled over when Abraham Lincoln, the presidential candidate opposed to the expansion of slavery, won the 1860 election. In response, seven slave holding states began to secede from the United States, starting with South Carolina on December 20, 1860. After secessionist forces fired on Fort Sumter on April 12, 1861, four more states seceded including Virginia on April 17th. When Virginia seceded, all eyes turned towards the state of Maryland. Looking at the map on the ground before you, it\u2019s easy to see why. If Maryland, a slave holding state, were to secede from the United States, then Washington D.C., the nation\u2019s capital, would be surrounded. For that reason, Abraham Lincoln had to ask himself\u2026 how close would he follow Francis Scott Key\u2019s words referring to the United States as the \u201cland of the free and home of the brave\u201d both when it came to the issue of slavery, but also the laws, policies, and controversial actions taken here at Fort McHenry to keep Maryland in the United States.", "audioFileUrl": "https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/B71AD619-E236-9860-DF8A94688B5B939D.mp3"}, {"significance": "An overview of the fort's appearance during the Civil War.", "assetId": "0E09F586-2497-4099-99F8-B944E3955546", "assetName": "Flag Pole", "assetType": "places", "id": "B758F66B-A2EE-C701-66E9506D1389C855", "ordinal": "2", "directionsToNextStop": "Turn around face the entrance to the fort.

One of the most notable differences is that the barracks buildings before you have second floors and porches that were added on in the late 1820\u2019s and early 1830\u2019s. The building to your right was originally the commanding officer\u2019s quarters but was converted into enlisted men\u2019s barracks in the 1830\u2019s as well. Larger barracks were necessary due to the presence of larger coastal cannons such as the 1840 coastal guns that surrounded the outside of the fort during the Civil War. These coastal artillery pieces could fire larger shells for greater distances, but also required more men to comprise the gun crews, increasing the garrison size to the point where expansions had to be made. \n\nThe barn shaped structure you see to the right is the powder magazine. This building is larger than it would have appeared during the War of 1812, having been improved and walls thickened to make it bomb proof. If you get close enough to the powder magazine, look for the discoloration of bricks to see where the original roof was. The fort expanded beyond the walls around you as well. Commanding officers had houses down along the east lawn and close to the visitor center. More barracks were constructed where the modern-day Naval Operation Supply Center is, and at other sites that you\u2019ll be taken to on this tour. These facilities further emphasized the fact that during the Civil War \u201cFort McHenry\u201d was more than just the star fort structure, but instead the entirety of this peninsula.

Go past the entrance to the open door on your left.", "audioTranscript": "Following the attack on Fort Sumter and the start of the American Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to put down the rebellion. The call for troops enraged Maryland secessionists, raising tensions in Baltimore transitioning the city into a powder keg ready to explode. The crisis came to head on April 19, 1861 when the 6th Massachusetts regiment marched through the city from the President Street Rail Station to the Camden Station on their way to Washington D.C. The sight of United States troops marching through the city infuriated secessionists who began attacking the troops, creating a riot. In the end, 4 soldiers and 12 civilians were killed, and 36 soldiers and hundreds of civilians wounded in what would become known as the \u201cPratt Street Riots.\u201d\n\nWith tensions rising and the outbreak of violence in Baltimore, fear rose that Maryland would secede, thus leaving Washington D.C. surrounded, effectively ensuring an easy victory for the Confederacy. The United States government\u2019s response to the Pratt Street Riots was swift and severe. In July of 1861 General John A. Dix took command of the newly formed Middle Department of the United States Military. Dix set up his command at Fort McHenry and immediately sought to get the secessionist infested city to comply with federal rule. Dix invited several prominent Baltimore women who had known southern sympathies to be entertained at Fort McHenry. During the event Dix took the women up to bastion 1 (where you currently stand) and directed their attention to the large Columbiad cannon. The cannon was pointed in the direction of Monument Square at the center of the city. Dix informed his guests \u201cif there should be another uprising in Baltimore, I shall be compelled to try to put it down; and that gun is the first that I shall fire.\u201d And so, Fort McHenry would continue to operate for the entirety of the Civil War, with cannons pointed to protect the city\u2019s harbor entrance, but also at the city itself.\n\nOther forts were constructed around Baltimore with the same purpose, such as Fort Federal Hill and Fort Marshall, located closer to modern day Patterson Park. Between these three forts, anywhere in the city could be fired upon and the center of town could be fired upon from three different locations. The constant threat of bombardment and enforcement of martial law were just some of the drastic measures taken by the federal government to keep Maryland from seceding.

The writ of habeas corpus is what gives a person under arrest the right to be brought before a judge or court. With the writ suspended, any Maryland citizen accused of committing treasonous activities could be arrested and held in prisons like Fort McHenry without ever seeing trial. In September of 1861 a newspaper journalist by the name of Frank Key Howard, grandson of Francis Scott Key, was arrested for writing articles critical of the Lincoln administration in The Daily Exchange, a Confederate sympathizing newspaper. Howard and was held in Fort McHenry under the suspension of habeas corpus. This stroke of irony led Howard to nickname the same fort that inspired his grandfather to write the words \u201cland of the free,\u201d as the \u201cAmerican Bastille.\u201d\n\nAnother Marylander arrested and held at Fort McHenry was John Merryman. Merryman was a member of the Baltimore County Horse Guards, a militia group that, after the Pratt Street Riots, burned railroad bridges leading into Baltimore to prevent US troops from entering the city. Merryman\u2019s plight was brought to the attention of Roger B. Taney, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. When Taney ordered Merryman be brought to his court room and commanders at Fort McHenry refused, the justice issued a Supreme Court brief, Ex parte Merryman. The brief stated that the authority to suspend habeas corpus did not lie within the president\u2019s power, but instead in Congress\u2019s. The United States Congress would uphold Lincoln\u2019s suspension in 1862. \n\nWhile the majority of the prisoner holding centers were outside of the main fort structure (as you\u2019ll see later in this tour) this guardhouse was used to house the particularly high-risk prisoners. The guards' room before you is quite spacious, however the three adjacent cells are dark and narrow. Henry Hall Brogdan, a member of the Confederate Signal Corps, was captured May 3, 1863, and was imprisoned in the upper-most cell. Brogdan described his time in the cell by stating, \"At no time were the walls of my cell dry, near the wall particularly.

The large earthworks supported by brick were a vast improvement over the much smaller and out of date water battery that had gone around the peninsula. Large powder magazines were constructed under the earthworks to store black powder and ammunition for the guns placed on the outside of the fort. By July 1861 and the start of the Civil War, there was a total of 76 canons and mortars at Fort McHenry including eighteen 42 pounders, fourteen 32 pounders, and seven 24 pounder Columbiad canons. Although out of date for the time of the Civil War, these artillery pieces were vital for protecting Baltimore\u2019s harbor and strong arming the city into submission.\n\nThe large guns you see before you, however, are Rodman guns. Rodmans, better known as the \u201cLincoln Gun,\u201d were developed in the lead up to the American Civil War and are a perfect example of how quickly technology can develop during wartime. At the beginning of the war Rodmans were considered the most up to date technology for coastal defense. Thanks to new and experimental iron casting technology, the large guns could fire massive shells weighing up to 450 pounds a distance of approximately four miles and could outlast traditional cannons. The Army began plans to replace Fort McHenry\u2019s guns in 1864, however due to production needs and the manpower needed to transport the massive guns (some weighing as much as 50,000 pounds) the first Rodmans did not arrive until 1866, a year after the Civil Wars conclusion. By this time the Lincoln Gun was out of date. Its traditional muzzle loading process was being replaced with breech (or rear) loading technology. In addition, its smooth bore barrels were less accurate than those with rifled barrels, although some of the cannons before you were converted later.\n\nFort McHenry\u2019s fourteen Rodmans are the largest collection in the United States. Their continued preservation and display give the fort the appearance of most coastal defenses from the American Civil War.", "audioFileUrl": "https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/B7AE0CC1-E725-27E6-E5071656C6C3A173.mp3"}, {"significance": "Learn how the Civil War gallows maintained order within the prison complex of Fort McHenry.", "assetId": "C6A3E637-977E-48BA-AC7C-CDC4AD7A428C", "assetName": "Orpheus Statue", "assetType": "places", "id": "B7E6D922-EC78-EA2F-FBD405BAFF0F50F2", "ordinal": "6", "directionsToNextStop": "Turn from the statue of Orpheus to face the brick structure near the statue.

This site represented fear and dread for the imprisoned Confederate soldiers, spies, guerillas, and blockade runners, but also served as a warning to Union soldiers who may be considering crimes such as desertion or murder.\n\nOne Confederate executed on this site was Andrew Laypole, a Captain in the Confederate Army, also known by his alias Isadore Leopard. Captured in April of 1863 outside of Winchester, VA, Laypole was accused of being a Confederate guerilla and was sentenced to death which occured on May 23, 1864. A newspaper reported the scene as such: \n[he] made a short address to those around him, stating that he appeared as a felon, but there was one who knew he was not of that character. He said freely [and] forgave all having to do with his death\u2026 on the conclusion of which the rope was placed around his neck, and everything being in readiness, the word was given and he was suspended in the air.\n\nTwo years prior, on March 7, 1862, Private Joseph Kuhne of the 2nd Maryland Regiment of the United States Army was executed on the same spot. Kuhne had killed his Second Lieutenant just six months prior. He was to be made an example of so other soldiers, specifically those garrisoned at Fort McHenry, knew the consequences of such actions. 4,000 Federal troops gathered on these grounds to witness Kuhne\u2019s execution. With the audience in attendance and Kuhne in position on the scaffold the scene was described:\n\nWhen Col. Morris inquired if he had anything to say before his death, the doomed man replied that he had not. In another instant the trip fell with a dull heavy sound, and Joseph Kuhne was suspended in mid-air\u2026  which he hung still and lifeless\u2026\n\nAt least five soldiers and/or spies sentenced to death at Fort McHenry are known to have had their sentences commuted by President Lincoln. In one such case Private George W. Kimball of the 5th Massachusetts Regiment said of Lincoln\u2019s pardon, \u201cThe President has seen fit to have their sentences changed to imprisonment. I think he shows [too] much leniency for I think if anyone should be hung it is a [spy].\u201d", "audioFileUrl": "https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/B7D1830B-BBE8-F679-488C9AD1FF9EDD6F.mp3"}, {"significance": "Learn how the fort grounds contributed to daily life in Fort McHenry during the Civil War.", "assetId": "80C2F7F1-439E-4D43-83C7-066D53772061", "assetName": "Civil War Powder Magazine", "assetType": "places", "id": "B7FE4B0E-DBC9-F151-24CA8E27E1255B56", "ordinal": "7", "directionsToNextStop": "Continue along the path leading towards the road.

As you heard earlier, technology develops quickly in times of need. The new and upgraded armaments used more powder than the fort had space for. Improvements were hastily made. New powder magazines were built into the ravelin and outer battery. In the Sally Port, the old bombproof casements were expanded as well. However, as noted by an officer, storing large amounts of powder in the Sally Port wasn\u2019t the wisest decision. The main entrance to the fort was vulnerable to \u201ccommon throughfare, with people passing all the time, [and] men smoking.\u201d  \n\n In 1863, these concerns led the War Department to approve the building of a detached powder magazine.  Located well outside the fort, the magazine in front of you would help solve Fort McHenry\u2019s storage crisis. The inner brick vault is 28 feet by 50 feet and is built with very thick walls. A courtyard separates the inner structure from the outside wall. Completed in April 1864, the Civil War Powder Magazine can hold 1,500 barrels of powder. \n\nAlthough outside of the star fort structure, the powder magazine was still in the heart of activity of Fort McHenry. It\u2019s important to note that during the Civil War \u201cFort McHenry\u201d was a name for not only the star fort, but the entirety of this peninsula. Between this structure and the water would have been sutler tents, store tents, and even a hospital tent. The large grassy area you see between this building and the road was the fort\u2019s parade ground. This was the area that the fort\u2019s large garrison would gather to march in formation and go through cannon and musket drills, all important tasks to keep the soldiers sharp and ready for battle.\n\nThe next stop proceeds to the main gate.

It was built in 1837 on the boundary of newly acquired land. During the early 1860\u2019s, the gate and it\u2019s brick walls separated Fort McHenry from tension-filled Baltimore. Outside of the gate, concerned women left fresh vegetable and food to be delivered inside.   Inside the gate, regiments of United States soldiers went about their daily duties, and prisoners found creative ways to pass the time. \n\nIn April of 1861 this gate was the site of major tension. Following the Pratt Street Riots Fort McHenry remained on high alert preparing for any pro-secessionist attack that might occur. Field pieces were moved into position to be able to fire down the fort road ahead of you if any enemy forces came into range. On April 20th the Baltimore Police Commissioner, John Davis, offered to send a force of 200 men to help repel any attack that may take place. The fort\u2019s commander at the time, Captain John Robinson, fearing that the force of men would actually be secessionists, informed Davis that if any men came past the Catholic chapel on the fort road that he would fire upon them, and then the city. The police commissioner replied, \u201cIf you do that, and if a woman or child is killed, there will be nothing left of you but your brass buttons to tell who you were.\u201d And so, the standoff between Fort McHenry and the City of Baltimore would continue throughout most of the war.  \n\nIn July of 1862, nearly 2,000 soldiers were being medically treated in Baltimore. Over 1,000 more were at Fort McHenry. On September 17, 1862 the battle of Antietam would take place in Western Maryland. Being the bloodiest single day in American history with 23,111 casualties, medical facilities in the state and Baltimore were overwhelmed. A hospital was constructed at Fort McHenry to the left of the gate in front of you to accommodate the arriving wounded. Women of Baltimore brought food and supplies to the wounded Confederate soldiers being treated within the gate. So many supplies were being brought to this gate that General Morris ordered:  \n\n\u201cno person or carriage whatsoever will be permitted within the gates of Fort McHenry with clothing or provisions to the rebel prisoners. Supplies of this kind will be deposited with the guard at the exterior gate for that office, where they will be duly distributed to those requiring this aide.\u201d \n\nToday, we encourage you to look past the gate and into Baltimore. This gate was the first thing a prisoner would see upon arriving to the Fort. It was a reminder of the divide between citizens, ideals, and beliefs - and the lengths at which the government would go to keep the United States together.", "audioFileUrl": "https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/B80E60E0-F4C7-B75F-9027CC639764DA61.mp3"}, {"significance": "The location of the Civil War prisons.

They were comprised of 3 two-story buildings that were originally built as stables in 1843. At first, only two of the stables were converted into prisons. The buildings were split into rooms, with 2 on each floor. The rooms were designated to hold different categories of prisoners, such as Confederate Prisoners, Union Bounty Jumpers, Citizens, and African Americans. Additionally, there was one room for guards and one that contained seven cells. These cells nicknamed \u201cThe Black Hole of Calcutta\u201d, contained the more violent prisoners at Fort McHenry. These first two prisons were surrounded by a courtyard and a 25-foot-high stockade wall. This courtyard was used for exercise, rollcall, and recreation. \n \nPrisoners came up with creative ways to pass the time. While lively and intellectual discussions and debates were present, they also played games using what was around them. For example, one prisoner recalled a \u201cgreat sport\u201d where lice from the prisoners were made to fight against ants. Some recreational activities were not just to pass time, but also served to mock the United States Soldiers around them. One such activity mimicked the morning dress parade, complete with a drum-major and musicians.  \n \nIn July of 1863, after the Battle of Gettysburg, the prison population swelled to 6,957 POWs. With limited space for the large influx of Confederate Prisoners, the third stable, previously used for officer\u2019s horses, was converted so fast that as prisoners were led in, the horses were led out.  Reverend T.D. Witherspoon described the cells as such:\nThe floor, which separated us from our neighing neighbors beneath us, was full of broad seams from the shrinkage of boards of which it was composed, so that the hot, steamy air from below had full access to us, and during the oppressive days and sultry nights of July and August, with the thin roof of shingles between us and the sun, and the steam arising from the stalls beneath, our situation was anything but comfortable\u2026\n\nMost prisoners would not spend a long time in the \u201cAmerican Bastille\u201d. Fort McHenry was used as a temporary stop before they were transferred to a more permanent location. Over 15,000 people would be held at Fort McHenry from 1861-1865. By September 1865, only four remained, and the Union, following four years of conflict and bloodshed, remained intact.", "audioFileUrl": "https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/B834A751-DACD-ED6B-086DC74D3118E851.mp3"}], "images": [{"credit": "NPS/Tim Ervin", "crops": [{"aspectRatio": 1.78, "url": "https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/primary/B7060DE8-0738-B03F-CE56EF234245CEDF.jpg"}, {"aspectRatio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/secondary/B7060DE8-0738-B03F-CE56EF234245CEDF.jpg"}], "title": "American Bastille", "altText": "A man in 19th century clothes in a jail cell.", "caption": "A living historian replicates what it would have looked like to have civilians imprisoned at the for", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/B7060DE8-0738-B03F-CE56EF234245CEDF.jpg"}]}

It may seem like just a simple trail, but if you look closely it will tell the story of the progression from footpaths to roadways.\n\nImagine what this island would look like with no roads\u2026. How about with no trails! It would certainly be difficult to get around in this rugged lava landscape. When the Polynesian Voyagers arrived in the Hawaiian Islands, that was their reality. An untouched, rugged, lava wilderness. So, in ancient times, a network of trails was constructed to connect people, places, and resources.\n\nThis section of trail is called the 1871 Trail, due to improvements made in\u2026 You guessed it, 1871. However, this small segment of trail is just one section of the larger Ala Kahakai National Historic Trail which is the 175-mile-long trail corridor that traverses from the northernmost tip of the island, along the western edge, around the southern tip and into Puna.\n\nThis historic trail generally follows the ancient coastal\u202falaloa, or long trail that formed primary route of travel around the island. The alaloa that the Ala Kahakai NHT follows is sometimes referred to as the \"alanui aupuni,\" the Hawaiian Kingdom government road, that you can still see as the \"King's Trail\" in North Kona/South Kohala or the \"M\u0101malahoa Trail\" in North Kona which intersects our sister park, Kaloko-Honok\u014dhau National Historical Park. This ancient network of trail also included shorter more locally important trails like the alahele that ran laterally with the shoreline, and the\u202fmauka-makai\u202ftrails, that ran from upland areas to coastal areas.\n\nOver the years, many of these anicent trails were straightened and widened to reflect changes in transportation while others were simply abandoned. Some of the trails that survived the tests of time were preserved, like the Ala Kahakai NHT, or even converted into roadways we know today. As you continue down the trail you see evidence of this evolution as you will pass historic and ancient structures, see impressive geologic features, and immerse yourself in the kahakai (coastal) environment.", "audioFileUrl": "https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/9CF25A22-9D4C-A272-4E688E3CF34F3182.mp3"}, {"significance": "", "assetId": "D097009D-5FDC-4B78-9C9B-FBF4EED51474", "assetName": "A - H\u014dnaunau Holua", "assetType": "places", "id": "68C1C39F-9E94-06E6-8B3842A60771A24A", "ordinal": "2", "directionsToNextStop": "Continue down the trail.

That's a h\u014dlua sledding track. He\u02bbe h\u014dlua, \"sled surfing,\" or \"land sledding,\" was an important ritual-sport in Hawai\u02bbi. A h\u014dlua slide was made of dry-set stones taking advantage of the natural inclines or hills to create a long-sloped ramp that was then covered in fresh soil and reeds making a slick surface which was then lubricated with kukui (candlenut) oil.\n\nIndividual riders rode down the slide on a papa h\u014dlua (sled), often reaching speeds of up to 60 miles per hour (96.6 kph) The papa h\u014dlua was carved from wood and was long and narrow in shape with two runners held apart by crosspieces. Two smaller rails sat on top of the crosspieces and acted as a platform. The whole sled was lashed together with coconut fiber. The sled could be as long as 14 feet (4.3 m) and weigh as much as 50 pounds (22.7 kg). See a functional replica of a papa h\u014dlua in the bookstore at the visitor center.\n\nThe papa h\u014dlua's design allowed riders a choice of different riding techniques on their journey to the bottom of the slide, with two techniques being the most popular. Riders using the first technique would stand sideways on the papa h\u014dlua, kick with one foot to launch themselves, and then put both feet on the sled and extend their arms for balance \u2013 much like a modern snowboard rider. Sliders using the second technique would jump onto the papa h\u014dlua chest-down, face forward, and grip the narrow sled tightly for control. Both techniques allowed skilled sliders to steer the papa h\u014dlua by shifting their body weight. Control of the papa h\u014dlua was essential as a mistake or loss of control meant injury or possible death.\n\nHe'e h\u014dlua was a prestigious ritual-sport in the Hawaiian Islands. It was played mostly during Makahiki, the four-month winter New Year's celebration in honor of the akua (god) Lono, and only the Hawaiian ali'i (chiefs) would compete in these races.\n\nWould you be brave enough to test your skill on the papa h\u014dlua?", "audioFileUrl": "https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/9D2F30A3-F597-A8B6-FFEDF6ED3AD12C24.mp3"}, {"significance": "", "assetId": "D4790043-1479-4881-84DD-87DA90D33F42", "assetName": "B - K\u014dnane Papam\u016b", "assetType": "places", "id": "68C8A93D-E56D-5DE3-E4437529D0C8A14C", "ordinal": "3", "directionsToNextStop": "Continue down the trail.

Networks of stone walls, called kuaiwi, could also serve as raised trails or causeways themselves. \n\nYou may also notice that stones line the edges of the trail. These curbstones were part of improvements made to the 1871 trail when it was widened to easily accommodate two horses at one time. The curbstones delineated the trail making it easier for pack animals to follow it without constant guidance from their riders. Around the island, these types of \u201ctwo horse trails\u201d were constructed during an 80-year period lasting from 1841-1918.

So, it was pretty dangerous!\n\nThere is no clear indication as to when the original ramp was built, but it most likely occurred sometime in the mid-1800s when a series of large-scale government programs were initiated to improve to public resources, such as roadways. However, the first version of the ramp would definitely not have held up to our modern-day safety standards. Local paniolo (Hawaiian cowboys) described the original ramp as the \u201cone-foot-out trail,\u201d as they would ride up and down the ramp with one foot out of the stirrup just in case they had to make a hasty escape due to the poor condition of the ramp.\n\nDue to this dangerous part of the commute to Ki\u02bbilae village, improvements were made in 1868 to widen and stabilize the ramp. In a letter to the Hawaiian Kingdom Minister of the Interior dated Feb. 4, 1868 George Hardy, the road supervisor at the time, said:\u202f\n\n\"In South Kona, I have repaired [a very] bad place known by the name of Alahaka in the village of Ki'ilae, a place of great danger where several horses had been kill'd: and where people were [sic] in danger of going up and down. I have made it wide and a substantial road.\"\n\nUnfortunately later that year, in 1868 there was a particularly destructive eruption event from Mauna Loa that caused multiple massive earthquakes (7-7.9) which in turn caused tsunamis and landslides across the island. During this event, the ramp may have been damaged and by the late 1890\u2019s the Alahaka Ramp had fallen into a state of disrepair. In a letter dated December 31, 1897 road supervisor T. H. Wright wrote:\n\n\"Napo\u2019opo\u2019o to Ho\u2019okena beach road in a fearful condition, it needs repair of the worst kind. The Walahaka [Alahaka] pali (cliff) is very dangerous. This road is used every day for the convenience of the public, going and back to these places.\"\n\nOver the years, repairs were made, but in 1951, a large earthquake caused an upper section of the ramp to slough off and that continued to deteriorate. So, when the National Park Service came in, about twelve years later, the ramp was once again in a state of disrepair. This prompted a major stabilization project to restore and strengthen the Alahaka Ramp. Stabilization efforts consisted of removing the earthquake-damaged sections, clearing away boulders, and rebuilding the entire\u202fmakai\u202f(ocean-facing) side.\n\nGiven its proximity to the ocean and the cliffside, even today the Alahaka Ramp requires periodic maintenance and stabilization as a result of high surf, storm, and earthquakes. During the most recent effort, which occurred in 2010, NPS crews repaired a damaged portion of the outer face and stabilized the ramp buttress and trail trea This, of course, was no easy feat, as the work was located right along the steep ocean cliffside.\n\nAs the years go on, and climate change causes increased storm intensity and sea level rise, these coastal trails will require a sustained joint effort to continue to preserve these pieces of history and the stories they contain.

Below the house site is one of the few suitable canoe landing spots along this stretch of coast. As you continue down the trail a little bit, look back up at the house site and notice the gradual slope down to the water. That\u2019s the spot!

With tin roofing came the ability of water catchment, and thus the cistern that you can see in what remains of the house site. However, even with water catchment, rain on the South Kona coast is not guaranteed, and in many cases, the Ahu cistern had to be filled via mule train from the wetter areas up mauka (mountain). \n\nEven today, many residents of South Kona live on rainwater catchment systems, however when the catchment is low, water trucks and roads allow for much easier access to freshwater than the mule trains of the past.", "audioFileUrl": "https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/DBCA7D59-BF5D-0EA1-98308EC961103B1E.mp3"}, {"significance": "", "assetId": "15F92E0F-B1F9-4B2B-9DAE-856BA31D5147", "assetName": "L - Ki\u02bbilae Village", "assetType": "places", "id": "71F8F79B-EBA1-FAD9-F45B378BFF23993C", "ordinal": "14", "directionsToNextStop": "Continue down the trail.

With the arrival of Europeans in the Hawaiian Islands, many things changed. New plants and animals were introduced and settlements began moving away from the coastal villages to the more fertile uplands and larger harbor cities. What remains in Ki\u02bbilae today are abandoned house sites, agricultural features, animal pens, and salt pans that can be seen from more recent times.\n\nIt is not known exactly when Ki\u02bbilae village was established, but it may have been inhabited as early as the 1600\u2019s due to availability of water, fishing grounds and upland fields. Indigenous knowledge points to the early settlement at Ki\u02bbilae as a place where kahuna (priests) trained. By the end of the 19th century, Ki\u02bbilae had a population of approximately 100 people consisting of about 10 extended families.\n\nUnlike the difficulty assigning a beginning date for Ki\u2018ilae Village, the end of its occupation is well documented. By 1913 only one family remained in coastal Ki\u2018ilae, and sometime the 1930\u2019s the last full time resident moved away. Its depopulation was largely the result of a changing economy that focused increasingly around the mauka areas near the current M\u0101malahoa Highway. Green (1993:534) explains the changing economy and shifting population with the following:\n\nThe improved belt road around the island, which provided access to trade centers, effectively isolated the shoreline settlements, causing much of their population to move inland nearer to the road and the kula garden areas.\n\nSo, it seems that the change in community pattern along this coast was triggered not only from the evolution of transportation in the area, but also a change in the economy from a barter economy to a \u201cwork-for-money\u201d economy.\n\nAs you continue along the trail into the heart of Ki\u02bbilae village, remember to stay on trail and practice Leave No Trace principles to help protect these sites.", "audioFileUrl": "https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/A52E947B-B350-3254-0277D8AC19DF2489.mp3"}, {"significance": "", "assetId": "E54CDF6A-B795-458A-AA5E-804093B97E88", "assetName": "M - Kahikina House Site", "assetType": "places", "id": "720644AD-E410-1172-BC482958533E8377", "ordinal": "15", "directionsToNextStop": "Continue down the trail to the gate.

They were fisherman.\n\nLike many Ki\u02bbilae residents, fishing was essential for survival, but it was hard work. Most fishing gear was handmade, including the wooden canoes used to access the coastal waters. Fisherman, like the Kahikinas, would fish for \u02bb\u014dpelu (mackerel scad) as well as ahi (tuna) if two people were available to haul the large fish aboard. Fisherman would often feed the fish, banging on the outside of their canoe beforehand to alert the fish. The fish would then gather, and a large catch could easily be achieved. These fish were a major source of income for members of the community. Fresh fish were sold by girls door-to-door before school and any fish leftover could be dried and sold to stores.\n\nJohn Kahikina, one of the last to leave Ki\u02bbilae, was an expert octopus fisherman. To see below the surface of the water when he was fishing, he would chew kukui nuts and then spit them in the water. The oil from the kukui nuts would create a make-shift window to the depths, allowing him to drop his lure on top of the octopus and quickly pull it up.\n\nHowever, as times begain to change, the traditional way of living could no longer sustain the remaining Kahikinas and as Frances Jackson states in his report on Ki\u02bbilae Village,\n\n\u201cJohn Kahikina explained, there was \u201cNothing to do, no work.\u201d The coastal waters still could be fished, the kula gardens were there, but the economy had changed; a money-making job was almost a necessity.\u201d", "audioFileUrl": "https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/A53E4476-EB90-8699-16E531AF7B03B156.mp3"}, {"significance": "", "assetId": "078FB68E-07E9-409A-A151-A9AF0E76BF0C", "assetName": "N - Mauka-Makai Trail", "assetType": "places", "id": "720BB2DE-A2A5-4F16-99BE3EC9275878ED", "ordinal": "16", "directionsToNextStop": "Go through the gate and continue down the trail.

These trails are referred to as mauka-makai trails and highlight the importance of connecting the resources available from mountain to ocean.\n\nIn ancient Hawai\u02bbi, the land was divided into long sections called ahupua\u02bba that ran from the mountain to the ocean providing the people living in them almost everything they needed to survive. Larger trees for carving from the forest, fertile lands with ample rainfall in the kula (uplands), and abundant ocean resources from the kahakai (coastal area). Resources from each area were meticulously managed and shared throughout the ahupua\u02bba along mauka-makai trails.\n\nWhile the primary village area for Ki\u02bbilae was concentrated in this coastal area around the 1871 trail, as historian Frances Jackson (1966) states,\u201cto attempt to show Ki\u2018ilae Village as existing only at the shore would show barely a third of the life of the villagers.\u201d \n\nFamilies also maintained kula gardens with \u02bbuala (sweet potato), yams, pumpkins, squash, k\u014d (sugar cane), papaya, mai\u02bba (bananas), pia (arrowroot), ipu (gourds), and ulu (breadfruit). These kula gardens were located far enough upslope to receive regular rain. In addition to kula gardens, many also cared for dryland kalo (taro) fields located even further upslope. A network of trails connected fields to field houses and to a mauka-makai trail that served as the main artery for travel between the mauka gardens and the coastal residences.\n\nThis is no longer a maintained trail.

Later, stone walls were modified to accommodate ranching operations in the area.\n\nWithin the walls would be a house platform upon which a house would be built. In Ki\u02bbilae village, the majority of the houses were the old-style thatched grass houses. However, the more \u201cwell-to-do\u201d houses were constructed with modern lumber and had tin roofs, like the John Ahu house. Showing the transitional nature of these times, some houses met halfway with thatched walls and a tin roof. Houses typically were just one large room for the entire family.\n\nOne of the things that all of these house site had in common was the lack of a bathroom or even a pit outhouse. Bathing was done in the ocean and other activities were just done outside or in the tidal areas. The village also did not have electricity. In the evenings, light was provided by kerosene lanterns or kukui nut lights in which sundried kukui nuts were strung onto coconut midribs and lit.

The park\u2019s namesake, Fort Raleigh, is a small earthwork likely constructed in 1585 by an English military expedition, the second of four English expeditions to arrive at Roanoke Island in the 1580s. The third English expedition in 1587 is known as the \u201cLost Colony.\u201d Archaeologists and historians are still unsure if this earthwork has any relationship to the lost colony as the diaries of lost colony governor John Wright seemed to indicate that their settlement was independent of this earthwork. The 115-man military expedition, under the command of Ralph Lane, arrived at Roanoke Island in the summer of 1585. Initially greeted warmly by the native Algonquian the relationship between the two groups soon broke down, primarily due to disease the English brought which the Algonquian had no immunity to. The construction of this earthwork may reflect the need for the 115-man English force to protect themselves from Algonquian attacks as relations deteriorated or possibly to defend against the Spanish who sometimes sailed the coastline of the Outer Banks.  It is also possible that this earthwork was constructed to defend an English metallurgy workshop that operated nearby. We do know that Ralph Lane had prior experience designing and constructing other earthworks in Ireland and the Caribbean. The earthwork likely housed a small number of cannons, a powder magazine and other small rudimentary structures. Note the earthwork\u2019s small size, however. It is unlikely the 115 manned attachment would have been able to occupy it at one time. This has led archaeologists and historians to theorize that the earthwork could possibly be a smaller satellite structure with a larger defensive structure as yet unearthed. Despite the uncertainty as to the earthwork\u2019s purpose, its existence is evidence of the early English presence here on Roanoke Island. The location of the earthwork has been known for centuries. President James Monroe visited the site in 1819 and civil war soldiers stationed on Roanoke Island frequently wrote about the earthwork\u2019s existence in diaries and letters. The first official excavations of the earthwork took place in 1947 under the direction of archaeologist J.C. Harrington. In 1950 the earthwork was reconstructed on its original perimeter.", "audioFileUrl": "https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/E7D42D2B-FB9E-D5F3-5F16A8C1A15A8438.mp3"}, {"significance": "The site of the Gans Workshop is some of the most concrete archeological evidence of the original settlement in the late 1500s.", "assetId": "CBEE965B-B566-4E80-B7A4-988CEA89AEE6", "assetName": "Gans Workshop", "assetType": "places", "id": "BD000329-D0F6-4E0D-862A80ACB72E29F7", "ordinal": "4", "directionsToNextStop": "Continue walking down the path towards the Waterside Theater.

These communities grew as more and more African Americans migrated to West Virginia in search of jobs. A source of both unity and heritage, black communities provided the essential elements for everyday living and survival.\n\nFor the men, the community helped meet their economic expectations through work in the mines, on the railroad, in timber or rock quarries. It also provided a safe haven away from work. A place to be a family: to socialize, recreate, attend church, and relax. For the women, the community was their home and their job. They worked to maintain the home, take care of the children and performing household chores. The women shopped for groceries and other necessities. They fed the chickens, hogs and other livestock and often raised a garden.  A few women were able to contribute to the household income as domestic workers in the homes of white families or in service-oriented jobs.       \n\nHaving a religious affiliation and organizing a church was a significant element of the African American community. Most residents were Baptists who enthusiastically participated in church services on Sundays and throughout the week. The church, like Quinnimont Missionary Baptist Church, offered both spiritual and social activities weekly and throughout the year. These events regularly brought families and the community together. Important events included day-long Sunday programs, weekly socials, gospel sings and annual events. Helen Powell notes that at her church in Glen Jean, West Virginia,\n\n\u201cWe would have cookies and ice cream for the kids on Children\u2019s Day. There was always a Mother\u2019s Day program and programs for Father\u2019s Day.  They would have big birthday dinners, and everybody would pitch in and bring a dish. It was like a community affair.\u201d  \n\nLiving in an industrial setting did not totally eliminate agricultural pursuits within the black community.  A household garden supplemented the family income and added variety to the diet.  On whatever space was available, African Americans grew vegetables. Small orchards of apple, pear, and cherry trees were common. Children and adults alike foraged for berries as they ripened during the summer months. Black walnuts and chestnuts were gathered in the woodlands during the fall. It was common to raise some kind of livestock, mostly chickens and hogs. All foods were eaten fresh, shared among community members or canned for winter use.\n\nMost African Americans growing up in this region remember that the work was hard and at times life was tough. However, they also remember having fun and time for recreational interests.  African American families loved to visit spending most Sunday afternoons with friends and family members. They enjoyed participating in baseball leagues, going to the movies, and attending musical events. Fishing and hunting were a pastime that many young boys and their fathers enjoyed doing together. Residents always looked forward to the annual visit of the Silas Green traveling minstrel show and its variety of black performers.  Mr. Ellis Ross recalls some of his memories growing up as a child,\n\nChildren attended 4-H camp during the summer at Camp Washington Carver.

Originally named \u201cThe West Virginia Negro 4-H Camp,\u201d it became known locally simply as \u201cClifftop.\u201d Each year, black children from all over the State came to enjoy the fun and experience of being a camper.\n\nAlthough not a 4-H camper himself, Norman Jordan recalls his memories of the camp. \u201cI had very vivid memories of going to the camp \u2026 to play baseball, swim, and have church picnics. Sometimes Dad would take me and my brothers and sisters along, and as soon as the car stopped at the camp we would jump out and run around on the grounds. [We would] bounce up and down on the see-saw, slide down the sliding board, and most of all ride on the merry-go-round.  [ I remember] the smell of chlorine at the bathhouse and the swimming pool, as well as the happy sounds of swimmers splishing and splashing in the water and diving off the diving board.\u201d \n\nThe seeds for an African American 4-H camp were planted in 1928 when West Virginia University hired James E. Banks and Lulu B. Moore.  As State Extension Agents, they were tasked with investigating 4-H Club activities for black children within the State.  Their report showed that forty-four of West Virginia\u2019s counties held 4-H camps for white campers, but no camps existed for black campers.  \n\nWith this information in hand, Dr. John W. Davis, president of West Virginia State College, began the process of seeking funding for an African American 4-H camp.  Other African American leaders in the state joined his efforts. Nearly a decade later, the West Virginia legislature appropriated $25,000.00 for the creation of a 4-H camp for black campers. The efforts of Dr. Davis also led to the receipt of a large Works Progress Administration (WPA) grant to help construct the camp.\n\nDr. Davis, who had \u201cfallen in love with the beautiful scenery and serenity of the land\u201d in the Clifftop area, chose the current location for the camp. Construction of the first buildings occurred between 1939 and 1942. WPA and Civilian Conservation Corps workers, along with prison laborers from Moundsville were the earliest construction crews. The Great Lodge, the largest log structure on site, was built entirely of West Virginia chestnut. It housed the assembly hall, dining hall, and kitchen. Other buildings included a two-room Guest House, a small cabin used as a Health Center, and dormitories for campers. A water tank and pond were also constructed.\n\n Use of the camp began immediately and reached its peak during the 1950s, when approximately 1,600 campers attended annually. A camper\u2019s day began with an early breakfast followed by cabin cleaning. The main part of the day was spent in activities including nature study, music, drama, and arts and crafts. Campers had instructional time in swimming, first aid, health care, and nutrition. Of course, recreational time included swimming and sporting activities.  After supper, campers had free time, followed by a play, evening vespers, and a camp fire.       \n \nBesides the 4-H camps, the African American community utilized the facility for a wide variety of activities and events. Boy Scout and Girl Scout camps, mining encampments, home economics encampments, church camps, and reunions were held here. The buildings were used for meetings, gatherings, and training classes by groups and organizations from around the state. West Virginia State College conducted staff and faculty trainings and special classes at the camp. The site was used for pre-season band and football conditioning by black schools. The camp was also utilized for the military training of black pilots and ROTC maneuvers. \n\nStatewide integration in the 1950s eliminated the need for a separate 4-H camp for African Americans. However, the creation of the camp in the 1940s filled a void in the lives of many West Virginia black residents. The Camp provided learning and recreational opportunities and instilled pride and built self-esteem in thousands of black youth. The Camp provided a safe environment for black children to participate in and enjoy amenities normally unavailable to them.  \n\nIn 1980, the camp was placed on the National Register of Historic Places and the name officially changed to Camp Washington Carver. Today, the Camp serves as a cultural arts center for the West Virginia Department of Culture and History.", "audioFileUrl": "https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/1E228F4B-9CAE-0EBB-5AE1E5B570AD1BE4.mp3"}, {"significance": "", "assetId": "E5B1B212-CB96-4026-AFEF-AA23362EFB5B", "assetName": "Winona", "assetType": "places", "id": "ABAD0FCA-A440-9FE8-37C2DE3387C2E89E", "ordinal": "3", "directionsToNextStop": "Physical Address:\tKeeney\u2019s Creek Road\nGPS Coordinates:\tN38.050158\t-W81.039922\nFrom the church, turn left and continue straight on Keeney\u2019s Creek Road (Route 85/2).

You do not have to tell him not to stand here or go yonder. He will find his \u201cproper place\u201d and will stay in it. The mere imparting of information is not education.\u201d  Carter G. Woodson\n\nWest Virginia can boast of more than its share of great African-American leaders. Booker T. Washington and Henry L. Gates are among those who have made significant impacts on American thought and culture. Another leader who made a deep impact was Carter G. Woodson, the educator, historian, and publisher who founded the whole genre of African-American history. Woodson was the only American of slave parentage to earn a Ph.D. in history.  He wrote and published nineteen books and numerous articles, founded the first scholarly journal dedicated to African-American history, and started Negro History Week, which eventually became our current Black History Month.  \n\nAlthough Dr. Woodson\u2019s greatest achievements came later in life while he lived in Washington, D.C., his spent his formative years in West Virginia as a coal miner and educator. Woodson was born in 1875 near New Canton in Buckingham County, Virginia. Both his father and mother were former slaves. Poor, but fiercely independent, his father valued education and taught Carter to be \u201cpolite to everybody, but to insist always on recognition\u201d and respect. Frustrated by the lack of opportunity in Virginia, young Woodson left the family farm in 1892. He followed the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway into the New and Kanawha River region and found work on the railroad laying ties near Charleston. \n\nWoodson went to work at the Nuttallburg mine in the New River coal field at the age of seventeen or eighteen.  He worked hard in the mines, but also worked to receive an education and learned what little there was available on black history. Oliver Jones, who operated a tearoom for black miners out of his home, upon learning that Woodson was literate, engaged him to read the daily newspapers to the miners in return for free treats. Woodson later referred to Jones\u2019s establishment as \u201call but a reading room,\u201d with volumes that described black history, particularly stories of black Civil War veterans. His political education grew also as he read \u201cspeeches, lectures, and essays dealing with civil service reform, reduction of taxes, tariff for revenue only, and free trade.\u201d\n\nWoodson left Nuttallburg in 1895 and returned to Huntington to attend Frederick Douglass High School, the city\u2019s only black high school. He graduated in two years, and enrolled at Berea College in Kentucky, one of the few colleges that offered interracial education. He enrolled for only one quarter, but he picked up enough credits later at the University of Chicago to earn his bachelor\u2019s degree from Berea in 1903.   \n      \nWoodson returned to Fayette County in the late 1890s to teach at a school in Winona, just five miles from Nuttallburg. According to his biographer, he taught at \u201ca school established by black miners for their children\u201d from 1897 to 1900.  The 1900 Federal Census lists Carter G. Woodson as a \u201cboarder\u201d in the household of William M. Shorts. It also notes that he is 23 years old, single, Virginia-born, and working as a \u201cPublic School Teacher.\u201d\n\nWoodson left Winona in 1900 to return to Huntington where he taught history and was the principal at Douglass High School until 1903. From 1903 to 1907, he traveled to the Philippines to teach and serve as supervisor of schools and teacher-training. Woodson returned to the United States to attend graduate school. He obtained his master\u2019s degree in history at the University of Chicago, and his doctorate in history from Harvard. \n\nDr. Carter G. Woodson settled in Washington, D.C. where he taught in the segregated black schools of the Nation\u2019s Capital, published his first works on the history of black education, and founded the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History in 1915. As Director of the Association, Dr. Woodson launched a celebration of Negro History Week in 1926. He chose the second week of February to commemorate the birthdays of Frederick Douglass and Abraham Lincoln.  The annual week-long celebration was expanded into Black History Month in 1976.", "audioFileUrl": "https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/ABA1BF27-0CFC-6FA7-A6D7B3D615D718BC.mp3"}, {"significance": "", "assetId": "DA058403-B992-4E58-9073-D28105A5DB07", "assetName": "Nuttallburg", "assetType": "places", "id": "AC97BC89-012B-F7BB-2008970FF9851577", "ordinal": "4", "directionsToNextStop": "Hawks Nest Workers Memorial and Grave Site\nPhysical Address:\t98 Hilltop Drive, Lookout, WV 26679\nGPS Coordinates:\tN38.234467\t-W80.852690\nFrom Nuttallburg, return 6 miles to Hwy 60 West and turn left.

You go to a company school.\nYou work for this company according to the company rules.\nYou all drink company water and all use company lights.\nThe company preacher teaches us. What the company thinks is right.\nCarl Sandburg\n\nIn the late 1800s, coal became King in West Virginia. Over a sixty-year period, hundreds of coal mines were opened throughout southern West Virginia. To dig the coal, thousands of native Appalachians, African Americans, and immigrants from Europe migrated to the coal fields to work in the mines. To support the mining operations and their workers, \u201ccoal camps\u201d became as numerous as the coal mines.  Company towns, or \u201ccoal camps\u201d as they were commonly known, were built and owned by the coal companies themselves. They provided miners and their families a place to live, a place to buy goods and services, as well as opportunities for personal and recreational activities. In 1930, there were nearly 500 coal company towns in West Virginia.\n\nThe vast majority of African Americans who migrated to southern West Virginia found new lives in coal company towns. These mining camps were favored by black migrants because jobs were there. Camps also provided available and affordable housing. The 1900 U.S. census shows that a majority of residents in many of the coal camps were African American. Black miners living and working in mining camps like Nuttallburg, Hawks Nest, and Stonecliff made up over 55 percent of the population.  \n\nThe Nuttallburg mine and company town provides a fine example of an early New River Gorge coal mining operation.  John Nuttal, an immigrant from England, purchased land along the New River and founded the Nuttallburg Coal & Coke Company. He built a company town along the north side of the New River near the mouth of Short Creek.  In 1900, most of the African American men in Nuttallburg worked in the mine. There were black workers that also worked for the railroad and in construction. One African American worked as a clerk at the company store and another was a coke yard boss. For some 85 years, the Nuttallburg mine and coal camp provided work and a way of life for many African Americans.\n\nA coal company usually purchased or leased land around the mining operation on which to construct a town. A typical coal camp consisted of the tipple, coke ovens, a company store, church, school, post office, and company-owned housing.  In 1890, there were 110 company-owned houses in Nuttallburg. Monthly rental on a simple four-room company house amounted to one or two day\u2019s wages.  A 1922 survey found that over 80 percent of West Virginia miners rented their homes from a coal company. By 1900, Nuttallburg also had a doctor\u2019s office, blacksmith shop, club houses, and recreational facilities.\n\nWhat was life like for black miners and their families living in a company town?  Interviews of former coal camp residents indicate that segregation by status, race, and ethnicity existed in the coal camps. Black and white residents lived in different neighborhoods, worshiped in separate churches, and attended segregated schools. Housing for African Americans was often located on the outskirts of the camp or in a different hollow all together. In Nuttallburg, Short Creek divided the town. African Americans lived on the east side of the creek; white residents lived on the west side. Both communities had their own school, church, and clubhouses. \n\nIn the African American community, children attended a company school for black students. These schools typically went from first to eighth grade and ran five to six months a year. Students old enough to attend high school rode the train or bus to the closest town that had a black high school.  The church was an important part of the African American community in the coal camps. It offered both spiritual and social activities weekly and throughout the year. Most residents were Baptists or Methodist who enthusiastically participated in church services and events. \n\nWhen not working in the mines, black miners and their families enjoyed a variety of leisure and recreational activities within their community. Hunting and fishing were popular. Black residents enjoyed going to the theater, club houses, dance halls, and bowling alleys. Members of the community often gathered on front porches to play their guitars, banjos, and fiddles and to sing. Many African Americans spent Sunday afternoon visiting family and friends or watching a baseball game. Baseball was the miner's favorite sport with many camps having an all-black and all-white ball team. The Sunday afternoon baseball game was a major social event in the black community.\n\nDuring the 1950s, life in the coal camp began to change dramatically. As mechanization of the mines increased, more and more miners lost their jobs. It was often the black miner", "audioFileUrl": "https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/AC8D0C2B-A67C-C741-FEF1C1E73927E56B.mp3"}, {"significance": "", "assetId": "65F51BA2-74DD-40D9-BB76-53687DC9D9AA", "assetName": "Hawks Nest Workers Memorial and Grave Site", "assetType": "places", "id": "ACAAC796-C323-3CDC-D47E578B6A788D4D", "ordinal": "5", "directionsToNextStop": "Mt.

These tragedies are the result of disasters occurring in our coal mines, on our railroads and at industrial facilities like the Hawk\u2019s Nest Tunnel. This disaster became one of the worst industrial tragedies in the history of the United States.\n\nIn 1930, construction began on a three-mile tunnel through Gauley Mountain located between Ansted and Gauley Bridge, West Virginia. When finished, the Hawk\u2019s Nest Tunnel would divert water from the New River to a hydroelectric plant downstream. The water would be used to produce electricity for Union Carbide\u2019s plant at Alloy, West Virginia. In order to build the tunnel through solid rock, hundreds of unemployed men were recruited for construction jobs on the project. At least two-thirds of these workers were African Americans.\n\nAs the men drilled and blasted a 32-36 inch tunnel through the mountain, they drilled through rock that contained high levels of silica. The dry drilling techniques that was used released large amounts of silica dust into the air. This made working in the tunnel very dangerous. African American diggers emerged from the hole in the mountain covered with layers of white dust. The interior of the tunnel was a white cloud of silica, impairing vision and clogging the lungs of workers.\n\nBecause the Hawk\u2019s Nest Tunnel was licensed as a civil engineering project, even the most modest forms of safety were not applied. Workers labored in confined spaces with poor ventilation, a lack of dust control, and limited use of personal breathing protection. Within months, workers became sick from breathing silica dust. They showed signs of a lung disease called silicosis but were treated for a new disease called \u201ctunnelitis\u201d. Silicosis is a disease that inpairs the lungs leading to a shortness of breath and eventually death. Silicosis cannot be cured.\n\nThe length of employment in the tunnel rarely lasted more than a year. The dangerous work conditions and silica dust rendered many of the men unable to work. Excavation of the Hawk\u2019s Nest Tunnel lead to the greatest death toll ever from silicosis in the United States. Of the approximately 5,000 men that worked on the project; an estimated 2,900 worked inside the tunnel. At least 764 of these men died of silicosis. A majority of the dead were African Americans. In the years after the project was completed, many more would die due to their exposure to silica dust while working in the tunnel.\n\nWith the death of so many black workers, the problem of where to bury them became an issue. There were a limited number of burial sites for blacks nearby. To solve the issue, a funeral parlor in Summersville, West Virginia located an open field on Martha White\u2019s farm. This field became the burial grounds for many of the African Americans who died working on the tunnel project. Owen Symes a local resident remembers the cemetery like this:\n\n\u201cI used to rabbit hunt over there on the Martha White farm out in the fields before Rt. 19 came through here. I could see the graves. They were little soft mounds of dirt with grass over them. If you were not careful, you could step on one and it would cave in. They were in rows right up and down the fence line. They moved a lot of them when the highway came through. Dug up the graves and took what was left down by Hughes Bridge on the Gauley River to bury them again.\" \n \nToday, the tunnel continues diverting water from the New River to produce hydro-electricity for the Alloy plant. Silicosis has been designated as an occupational disease with compensation for workers. However, tunnel workers at Hawk\u2019s Nest were not protected by these laws. This memorial on Highway 19 was established to remember and honor the many victims of the Hawk\u2019s Nest Tunnel tragedy.", "audioFileUrl": "https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/AC9C9438-0EDD-FA61-849DA28A37F88CE3.mp3"}, {"significance": "", "assetId": "11D5A8FF-28C4-4146-983F-2D0EC0B67C57", "assetName": "Mt.

African Americans had descended from a rich religious and spiritual West African tradition, and were then exposed to Christianity during enslavement. Consequently, securing a place to worship consistently became, and has remained, a part of African American community development since Reconstruction.   \n\nAlthough African Americans in the region of Ansted, West Virginia were few in number throughout the antebellum/agrarian era, their numbers increased after West Virginia achieved statehood in 1863. Black workers became a necessary labor force during the initial years of West Virginia industrialization. The first African American industrial workers were employed in the region in the early 1870s with the construction of a branch of the C&O Railway and the opening of the Gauley-Kanawha Coal Company in Hawk\u2019s Nest.    In 1889, entrepreneurs and investors dissolved that company and created the Gauley Mountain Coal Company (GMCC), shifting coal mining from Hawk\u2019s Nest to nearby Ansted.  Ansted was incorporated in 1891.\n\nWhereas African American presence had been miniscule, the demands of coal mines and coke ovens prompted a steady increase in the number of black workers and residents.  Consistent with the traditional establishment of African American communities, Ansted residents soon began to address their religious and spiritual needs by congregating in homes for prayer meetings. In October of 1891, a revival took place and approximately twenty candidates were received for baptism. State Missionary Reverend Coleman agreed to administer baptism and organize a church.   The community soon petitioned the Gauley Mountain Coal Company to construct a church building. The congregation accepted the responsibility of paying $75 for labor, and Mount Chapel Missionary Baptist Church was constructed. A stipulation was that the building would revert back to coal company property once the church ceased to exist.   A cemetery was opened in 1893. \n     \nDue to the prevalence of churches in the New River region and the dearth of ministers to pastor those churches, it became customary for ministers to officiate at more than one church. Initially, Mount Chapel Baptist Church held church service only on the third Sunday of each month. Eventually, there was both a service and Sunday school on the first and third Sundays.\n\nAs in many African American communities, the Ansted African American church became the center of the community\u2019s existence. Most African American residents of Ansted were church members, and it was through the church that many of their cultural, individual, and family needs were met. The minister\u2019s message, soul-stirring spirituals, and biblical teachings provided inspiration and guidelines for daily life. Church members could be counted on to help celebrate births, weddings, and baptisms, as well as to give support and comfort when deaths or other tragedies occurred. Church related activities involved residents in special projects and recreational pursuits. In addition to Sunday services, there were prayer meetings, Bible study, revivals, church operating and planning meetings. Annual affairs included homecoming, the pastor\u2019s anniversary, picnics, and gospel sings. Mount Chapel Missionary Baptist Church, the sole African American religious institution in Ansted, served not only an important religious function, but also a social function.   \n\nWhile the Gauley Mountain Coal Company defined the economic expression of the Ansted community, Mount Chapel Missionary Baptist Church defined spiritual beliefs that influenced the attitudes and actions of its African American citizens.", "audioFileUrl": "https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/ACB01F85-A1B9-DA1C-ECEE7278F76756F7.mp3"}, {"significance": "", "assetId": "F4DE7CEA-4B35-499E-AD38-D1926251F630", "assetName": "Gauley Bridge Depot", "assetType": "places", "id": "ACCA4F77-9DA3-AD72-32D3F87C82267439", "ordinal": "7", "directionsToNextStop": "Bright Hope Lodge\nPhysical Address:\t65 Gaines Street, Montgomery, WV 25136\nGPS Coordinates:\tN38.179942\t-W81.315825\nFrom Gauley Bridge, take Hwy 60 West 10 miles to the town of Smithers, WV.

Three railroads opened the vast coalfields of Southern West Virginia to mining: the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway along the New and Kanawha rivers, the Norfolk & Western Railway through the Pocahontas coalfield, and the Virginian Railway into the Winding Gulf fields. This meant jobs building and maintaining the railroads as well as jobs in the coal mines. Jobs in these industries provided the opportunity for African American families to escape the \u201cJim Crow\u201d segregated society of the Deep South. African American men were able to build new lives as vital, more respected, and better-paid workers.\n   \nAfrican Americans made up the majority of workers whose sweat, muscle, and blood carved the C&O Railway, its branch lines, and other railroads through the mountainous landscapes. Constructed between 1869 and 1873, it employed thousands of black laborers. Journalist Jedidiah Hotchkiss wrote about black railroad workers in 1873, \n\nThey have proved in fact to be fine laborers, both as track-makers, and for mining, blasting, and all the other work of railroad building. They lived in shanties along the road, wherever their work lay \u2026  It [the road] was built almost entirely by the labor of negroes, who here proved themselves admirable and trustworthy workmen; sober, equal to the severest toil, and winning the good opinion of everyone. These blacks, of whom five thousand were employed on the road, [were] all formerly slaves in Eastern Virginia \u2026\u201d\n\nAfter construction was completed, the depot and rail yard here at Gauley Bridge, as at other towns along the rails, continued to provide black workers with steady jobs. Maintaining the tracks was called \u201clining track.\u201d It was a daily, hard-labor \u2013 a never-ending task primarily accomplished by black work crews. Often known as \u201cgandy dancers\u201d these men used songs and rhythm as a choreographed team. They aligned the track with precision, placing heavy wooden ties and steel rails, and driving in spikes. \n\nEach C&O rail yard, engine house, roundhouse, and depot required other workers to operate and maintain the massive coal- and water-powered steam locomotives as well as the coal, freight, and passenger cars. African Americans were employed as train porters, freight handlers, switch tenders, and engine shop workers.  \n\nFollowing the Civil War, George Pullman established the Pullman Sleeping Car Company. Pullman sleeper cars were contracted out to all the passenger railways in the United States and the porters hired to staff the sleepers were exclusively black. The Pullman Company grew to be the largest single employer of African Americans in the nation. In 1925, Pullman porters formed the first all-black union, the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters.\n\nAlthough the railroad provided employment opportunities for many African Americans, these jobs often required the hardest work while providing the lowest pay. Even with these challenges and the limitations of a segregated society, African American railroad men worked hard to provide for their families, and built strong black communities through church, school, and civic organizations.", "audioFileUrl": "https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/ACBDE51C-CCBF-04E4-14C87EFF54DD8EA2.mp3"}, {"significance": "", "assetId": "0348FB33-79BD-4F49-917A-EB34949A2688", "assetName": "Bright Hope Lodge", "assetType": "places", "id": "AD228D3E-A5F6-A8C3-C5DA2039DC8CE8D1", "ordinal": "8", "directionsToNextStop": "Harlem Heights\nPhysical Address:\t10 Broadway Avenue, Oak Hill, WV 25901\nGPS Coordinates:\tN37.998485\t-W81.131346\nFrom Montgomery, take Hwy 61 South 23 miles to Oak Hill and turn left on Hwy 16 North.

They shaped African American identity through rituals of brotherhood and protected members against poverty and other hardships. Although fraternal organizations originated in free black communities before the Civil War, thousands were founded during Reconstruction.\n\nFraternal organizations for black and white residents began before governmental aid and other assistance programs existed for the poor. Segregation and discriminatory practices made obtaining what little help that was available even more difficult for African Americans. African American fraternal organizations became a back-up plan for their communities. By collecting membership dues, they were able to aid the poor, the unemployed, orphanages, and widows, often providing burial funds.\n\nThe first black Masonic Lodge was founded by Prince Hall and fifteen black men in Boston, Massachusetts.  Their 1874 request for permission from white American Lodge members to establish a chapter of black Masons was denied.  In 1887, however, their petition to the Grand Lodge of England, where white American fraternal orders had originated, was honored and a charter was granted.\n\nThe influx of African Americans recruited into West Virginia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries brought a consistent increase in the formation of African American fraternal organizations. Steady employment on railroads and in coal mines made it easier for workers to pay dues in fraternal societies. Their membership brought a sense of unity and provided a social outlet for them and their families.\n\nBright Hope Lodge was organized on January 22, 1889 in Coal Valley, Fayette County. Coal Valley later became Montgomery, West Virginia. The official name was Bright Hope Lodge #12 and meetings were held in the first Lodge Hall, built on Third Avenue in 1890. The Lodge experienced significant growth in the 1890s and the early years of 1900; however, the Great Depression brought a decline in membership.  A merger of lodges in 1946 gave rise to Bright Hope Lodge # 9.  This transformation took place under the leadership of Worshipful Master Joseph R. Lawrence, Sr.   The current Lodge Hall was built in 1962.  Membership dues and fundraising activities continue to sustain the organization, support lodge functions, and address community needs.\n\nThe sister organization of Bright Hope Lodge # 9 is Naomi Chapter # 10 Order of the Eastern Star. It was established in 1920.  At that time they operated under the leadership of Lucy Hodge, the first Worthy Matron and Andrew Slaughter, the first Worthy Patron.  Working in conjunction with their Lodge brothers, they support and participate in functions and events within the organization and the overall community.  \n     \nBright Hope Lodge # 9 and Naomi Chapter #10 have created positive role models for African American males and females, promoted African American heritage and culture, instilled spiritual ideals, and served as an example of unity and strength. The organization has awarded scholarships to deserving students, provided food for the needy, worked with senior citizen and domestic violence programs, and supported NAACP initiatives and research projects associated with health issues. In the process of creating social connections for themselves and helping others, the organization has gained significant respect and support from community residents, businesses, and legislators of Fayette County.", "audioFileUrl": "https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/AD197779-D29B-0E4E-65A312E4F9C882C7.mp3"}, {"significance": "", "assetId": "26FEE608-570A-4652-9517-715C8C5AD0E0", "assetName": "Harlem Heights", "assetType": "places", "id": "AD35AF8C-D1A2-14FE-E3E90721DEE1558B", "ordinal": "9", "directionsToNextStop": "Thurmond\nPhysical Address:\tHwy 25/2, Thurmond, WV 25936\nGPS Coordinates:\tN37.957095\t-W81.078851\nFrom the park, turn right on Hwy 16 North.

While most African American communities in the New River area were coal mining or industrially-based, the residents of Harlem Heights had a variety of occupations.  In addition, the residents of coal mining towns usually lived in company houses, but most residents of Harlem Heights were homeowners.     \n\nIn the Harlem Heights area, the Homeseekers Land and Building Company charged \u201cvery little for lots.\u201d This allowed African Americans to be able to purchase land and build a home.  In what was basically an open field, African Americans began building homes and establishing a community.  Jessie Barret a resident of the neighborhood notes; \n\n\u201c[Harlem Heights] had five black families when I moved there in 1942.  The remainder of the area was farm land.  The section they called Harlem Heights had actually three streets. Lincoln Street, High Street, and Lewis [street].  [At that time] everything was inaccessible. We had the old fashioned outhouse for quite a while. We had about two wells with this huge long bucket you draw with.  We had to carry our water [and] catch rain water for laundry.  We had it rough for about a couple of years.\u201d        \n\nAs the community began to develop; paved roads replaced dirt roads. Residents acquired indoor toilets and running water as well as other amenities and services.  As the population grew, the community needed a school. In 1947, the Harlem Heights School was built and accommodated students in the first through eighth grade. High school students were bused seven miles to DuBois High School in Mount Hope, West Virginia. When schools were integrated in the 1960s, Harlem Heights students began attending the white elementary schools and Collins High School in Oak Hill. The school at Harlem Heights closed its doors in 1967.   \n\nHarlem Heights residents held a variety of occupations. Several were entrepreneurs who owned and operated stores and businesses right in the community.  Resident Terrance Tango Leggett remembers Ms. Classy\u2019s store, later known as Shug\u2019s Place, where residents could purchase necessities. Down the street was Mr. Bozo\u2019s store, with a dance hall on the second level.  Other residents worked as teachers, mining inspectors, seamstresses, and ministers. A few made their living as farmers. Sterling Hughes raised cattle and sold milk, cheese, butter, eggs and homemade hot dinner rolls from his farm. Some residents, especially women, held service- oriented jobs.  Of course, there were a few coal miners, but they did not represent the majority of residents.   \n\nThe people of Harlem Heights took pride in their community by keeping it clean and attractive. They actively supported their churches, civic clubs, and fraternal organizations. Some residents worked as community activists to move their neighborhood forward.  In the 1970s, Social worker Opal Leggett was responsible for starting and overseeing the Head Start program in Fayette County. Fayette County Legislators, Diane Smallwood and Reverend Frank Robinson as well as the honorable William Robinson were active as political organizers and community developers.   A neighborhood park was built in honor of Federal mine inspector Russell E. Mathews acknowledging his impact in the community. \n\nThrough all of these efforts, Harlem Heights grew to become a rather upscale African American community. Though relatively small, it grew large enough and politically active enough to have its own voting precinct. Today, the community has a Masonic lodge and three churches:  The Community Baptist Church, The First Baptist Church, and The Glorious Church of God in Christ.", "audioFileUrl": "https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/AD27A775-CF29-7AFD-280F99F81968072F.mp3"}, {"significance": "", "assetId": "38EF71BD-E05C-466F-B240-F0C3419C377A", "assetName": "McKendree Miner's Hospital", "assetType": "places", "id": "AD45FD7D-FA14-5D2D-E19749F08CC019A2", "ordinal": "10", "directionsToNextStop": "DuBois School\nPhysical Address:\t110 High School Drive, Mount Hope, WV 25880\nGPS Coordinates:\tN37.898051\t-W81.157067\nFrom Thurmond, return to Glen Jean and turn left on Hwy 16 South.

The Italians, Irish, African Americans and others who filled these jobs were subjected to hard physical labor, and dangerous work conditions. Work-related injuries and even death were hazards of the job. Injuries occurred almost-daily. Medical care and services were sparse and unavailable in most railroad towns and coal camps. Injured workers had to depend on home remedies. Some injuries led to disabilities, resulting in the worker losing his job and his family being evicted from their company-owned house.\n\nIn 1899, the State of West Virginia provided and improved medical care for both the working man and the general public. The State Legislature passed an act establishing three \u201cminer\u2019s\u201d hospitals within the state. Originally called Miner\u2019s Hospitals One, Two, and Three, they eventually took the name of the town where they were located. Miner\u2019s Hospital # 1 was built in the Town of Welch in the southern coal fields. Hospital # 3 served the northern coal fields and was located in Fairmont, WV. Hospital # 2 was constructed in the heart of the New River Coal Field. It became known as the McKendree Hospital. \n\nThe McKendree Miner\u2019s Hospital opened in 1901. It was built on land donated by New River coal operator Colonel Joseph Beury. The hospital provided free medical treatment for coal miners and railroad workers. All other patients were charged $1.59 a day for medical treatment. A whites-only nurse training program was established in 1901 to provide better qualified nursing staff at the hospitals. \n\nSeemingly isolated deep in the New River Gorge, the hospital was actually very accessible to people living throughout the region. The hospital was linked to each town and community by the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway and its branch lines. The railroad was the \u201cambulance\u201d service for workers and their families. A former nurse trainee, Thelma Louise Cashion, reflects back on her time working at the hospital\u2026\n\n\u201cThe hospital was almost always full of patients. Patients were divided into different wards. There were large White and Black male wards and smaller White and Black female wards. There were integrated private rooms available for the women and their babies who were delivered there. Most of the patients by far were men with very serious and traumatic injuries including cuts and crushed limbs requiring amputations and burns. In 1933, the hospital was inundated with patients during a typhoid fever epidemic.\u201d\n\nMcKendree Hospital closed as a medical facility in the 1940s due to its remote location and the closure of mines within the gorge. However, it continued to operate as a segregated nursing home for elderly black men and women. A decade later, the doors closed for good. The other two \u201cminers\u201d hospitals remained opened until the mid-1980s.  \n\nOver the years, the McKendree Hospital was slowly demolished, its bricks and building materials removed for reuse.  Today, the only access to the hospital site is along a very rugged road and hike through the forest. Like most of the coal towns of the once booming New River coal fields, the McKendree Hospital has been reclaimed by nature.", "audioFileUrl": "https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/AD3997E3-EEE8-3B87-6EC8831E7268EF6B.mp3"}, {"significance": "", "assetId": "9247A3A4-F996-487B-9995-3D70BBE2C211", "assetName": "Integration of Schools: DuBois High School; Mount Hope, WV", "assetType": "places", "id": "AD550122-C981-5F09-0D7B07A8E9BEB4A6", "ordinal": "11", "directionsToNextStop": "Slab Fork\nPhysical Address:\t374 Slab Fork Road, Slab Fork, WV 25920\nGPS Coordinates:\tN37.686920\t-W81.330368\nFrom Mt.

In West Virginia, school segregation was mandated by the State Constitution. West Virginia was one of seventeen states that had a dual school system; schools for white students and schools for African American students. At the time of the decision, there were 420,000 white and 26,000 black students attending school in West Virginia.1 African American students were not receiving an equal education. They were using outdated, second-hand books as well as band and school equipment passed down from white high schools. \n\nThe ruling did not come with specific recommendations; desegregation was left up to the individual states and often to the individual county school systems. By June of 1954, the institutes of higher learning in West Virginia had begun the process of desegregation. By September, twenty-nine of the forty-six West Virginia counties with African American students had also begun the process of integrating their K-12th grade schools. \n\nSome counties were reluctant and slow to integrate their schools. A few remained segregated until the mid-1960s. Other school systems maintained their dual school system allowing black students to attend an integrated school or continue to attend an all-black school. In most counties, desegregation went fairly smoothly; however, there were students and parents who protested against integration or boycotted efforts to integrate. None of these activities led to major violence. \n\nIn Fayette County, school officials announced that all schools would be integrated at the beginning of the 1956-57 school year. Here in Mount Hope, the older white high school was converted to a middle school. The white students were moved to the all-black DuBois High School which was the newer and nicer of the two high school buildings. DuBois was renamed Mount Hope High School. \n\nThe results of integration affected each person differently. African American principals before desegregation were demoted to teachers after integration. Many black teachers were the first to lose their jobs if there were not enough teaching positions at the combined schools. In some integrated schools, male black students were allowed to play on the football and basketball teams, but they could not play other team sports. African American girls were not allowed to be on the cheerleading squad. Throughout the region, black students were treated differently. At some schools they could not participate in the band or chorus, or join white-only school clubs and organizations; at others schools they could.\n\nArtifacts, trophies, yearbooks, and records from many of the black high schools were burned or placed away in boxes and forgotten. Kathleen Scott attended the segregated DuBois High School. For her, the most significant effect of integration was losing many of her friends who lived in more distant communities. \u201cOur friends from other parts of the county began going to high schools closer to where they lived,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we didn\u2019t get to see them anymore.\u201d It took West Virginia school districts almost a decade to become fully desegregated, and the closing of the African American schools resulted in a loss of community identity for black residents.", "audioFileUrl": "https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/AD526EAC-FD48-85B0-29D6EF83C3D7DBE1.mp3"}, {"significance": "", "assetId": "5D165812-A1FF-4600-9C06-D82F4C327D6D", "assetName": "Slab Fork", "assetType": "places", "id": "AD6A6665-D8CF-96AA-40EC12EF08AA1F64", "ordinal": "12", "directionsToNextStop": "Helen\nPhysical Address:\tTams Highway (Highway 16), Helen WV 25853\nGPS Coordinates:\tN37.636248\t-W81.314486\nFrom Slab Fork, return to Hwy 121 and turn left.

Though the years, the blending of these rhythms and melodies with those from Europe formed new and distinct musical sounds.

Known as \u201cNegro spirituals,\u201d they expressed the longing of enslaved people for spiritual and bodily freedom, for safety from harm and evil, and for relief from the hardships of enslavement.1 By the 1870s, spirituals began to be seen as music that revealed the beauty and depth of African American culture.2 In the early 1900s, the performance of \u201cNegro spirituals\u201d became a tradition among black singers.3\nAs African Americans migrated to West Virginia, they brought with them a diverse musical culture passed down from their enslaved ancestors. As they settled into the coal camps and railroad towns, the black community continued to cultivate its rich musical heritage, using oral musical traditions to pass stories and experiences down through generations. \nGifted singers within the black community could be counted on to improvise four-part harmony for the gospel hymns on Sunday morning.4 During the week, African Americans continued to express themselves through a variety of work songs like those used to synchronize the work of railroad track liners.5 Rhythms and melodies were also passed from generation to  generation. Many black musicians were self-taught, while others learned as apprentices from the best fiddle player or banjo picker in the community. \nMany types of music were enjoyed as part of African American life in company towns. One of the most important was \u201cThe Blues.\u201d The Blues, like the spiritual, is a product of slavery developed from African American work songs and European American folk music.6 Other varieties of music included string bands, gospel, quartets, and jazz. In the 1930s, big band jazz and dance music came to West Virginia; it was form of musical entertainment enjoyed by black mountaineers. Generally, music was played simply for enjoyment and relaxation.

Fields\nQuote By:\tXavier Oglesby\n\nBetween 1870 and 1930, thousands of white people, African Americans, and European immigrants came to West Virginia to work in the coal mines. African Americans migrated to mines throughout the State, but most of them came to work in the smokeless coal fields of Southern West Virginia. What they found was the opportunity to build a better life for themselves and their families. By 1909, African Americans made up over 26 percent of West Virginia mine workers.\n\nIn the mines, unskilled labor was in great demand. Many of the unskilled jobs-- coal loaders, mule handlers, and coke oven workers-- were filled by African Americans. About 75 percent of all black miners became coal loaders. African Americans preferred coal loading because it allowed them to simply leave the mine when they had loaded enough coal for the day. Coal loading also offered less direct supervision. Black miners usually did not see a foreman more than once during an entire shift. This was an important consideration for Blacks who came to the mines to escape the constant scrutiny of white people in the Jim Crow South.\n\nPicking and loading coal was hard, dangerous, back-breaking work; however, it provided the greatest opportunity for the miner to earn good money. As coal loaders, black and white miners were paid by the ton of coal mined, not by the hours worked. Hard-working miners could cut and load an average of five tons of coal daily, earning $2.20 to $5.00 per day.  Today, a West Virginia miner earns an average of $325.00 for an eight-hour day. \n\nFor nearly sixty years, coal was mined by hand using a pick, a drill, a needle, and a No. 2 and No. 4 shovel. A miner was required to purchase his tools from the company store. Once the black coal loader was underground, he performed the laborious tasks of cutting, drilling, blasting, and loading coal. William Tams\u2019s describes from his personal knowledge the job of a black coal miner. \n\u201cThe loader carried into the mine his picks, shovels, auger, tamping bar, fuse and a can of black powder. He was charged fifth cents per month for the services of the company blacksmith in re-sharpening and tempering the pick \u2026. After taking two and a half to three hours to make an undercut, the miners drilled, loaded, and fired the holes, bringing down the undercut coal. They then pushed up empty mine cars from the room mouth, loaded them, and returned them to the entry\u2026. The miner put his brass check near the bottom of each car he loaded. The check was removed after the car was dumped at the tipple and the load credited to the proper man.\u201d\n\nTo make an undercut, the miner had to lie on his side, wedged part way under the ledge of coal in order to make a four to six foot cut along the base of the coal seam. Undercutting the coal allowed it to fall to the mine floor when the coal was blasted. The miner then drilled holes into the face of the coal using a mechanical crank breast auger. Black powder, purchased by the miner, was rolled into paper cartridges and inserted into the drilled hole. The miner then inserted a long, thin, copper rod called a \u201cneedle\u201d into the hole. The blasting hole was then carefully tamped with clay mud and the needle extracted. A fuse was inserted into the cavity left from the needle. When the miner was ready to blast the coal, he shouted \u201cfire in the hole\u201d three times to warn fellow miners. The fuse was lit and the miner retreated to the nearest cross-cut for cover. If the powder was tamped and charged correctly, an ear-popping blast would bring the entire cut down to the mine floor.   \n\nOnce the dust settled, the miner began the laborious task of loading the coal into cars. It was critical that the miner load only clean coal because he was not paid for loading rock. When the car was full, he pushed it to the mouth of his room where it was hauled away to the head house. Before the miner could start a new cut, he had to perform \u201cdead work\u201d for which he received no pay.  Dead work involved installing roof supports, maintaining ventilation, and extending the tramway to the coal face. \n\nA tramway system similar to a light-duty railroad hauled the coal to the outside. Mule drivers and their brakemen, often African Americans, hauled the loaded coal cars to the mainline. There the cars were made up into trains and hauled to the headhouse. At the headhouse, the coal was weighed and the miner credited for payment. Until the advent of electric motors at the turn of the twentieth century, mules or horses were used to pull coal cars out of the mines. From the mine, some of the coal headed to coke ovens where black workers performed the hot and laborious job of tending the ovens. They shoveled coal into the ovens, fired the coal, then unloaded the finished coke into train cars, earning an average of $1.60 per day.", "audioFileUrl": "https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/ADC213A0-0DC0-5CB2-CE792B38E4456920.mp3"}, {"significance": "", "assetId": "62DA0797-8223-40AB-BDF7-9F78C51CA16C", "assetName": "Stratton High School", "assetType": "places", "id": "ADD24FBE-F817-161D-D6245B4F302B7E58", "ordinal": "14", "directionsToNextStop": "John Henry Park\nPhysical Address:\t3262 West Virginia 3, 25951\nGPS Coordinates:\tN37.652038\t-W80.762975\nFrom the school, continue on S.

Most slaveholders were fearful that an educated enslaved population would threaten their authority, spread abolitionist materials, and lead to insurrections. Southern states, including Virginia in 1819, passed laws prohibiting the education of enslaved people and free black people. These laws prohibiting the teaching of African Americans remained in effect until 1863 when West Virginia was carved out of the western portion of Virginia.\n\nThe adoption of West Virginia\u2019s Constitution in 1863 provided for the establishment of state schools, but made no references to the education of African Americans. Three years later, the Legislature passed a bill providing public schools for African Americans. This bill called for the establishment of black schools in sub-districts containing at least thirty black children between the ages of six and twenty-one. They had to maintain an average attendance of fifteen students, or face closure. The law was eventually amended to allow the establishment of schools in districts whenever there were at least ten black children of school age.  An 1872 revision of the State Constitution stipulated that white and black students should not be taught in the same school.\n\nIn 1866, the first public school for Black students was established in Parkersburg. The following year, Storer College in Harpers Ferry opened as the only school in the State where black youth could receive academic and normal training. Storer College offered courses in gardening, animal husbandry, sewing, instrumental music, cookery, blacksmithing and teaching. Its\u2019 graduates were some of the first African Americans to become teachers in West Virginia\u2019s black schools. The State Legislature eventually established the West Virginia Colored Institute\u2014now West Virginia State University\u2014in 1891. The Bluefield Colored Institute, now Bluefield State University, followed four years later. Both institutions provided teacher training.\n\nThe need for African American teachers increased drastically in the late 1800s with the opening of coal fields in the southern part of the state. The coal industry attracted large numbers of African Americans seeking good- paying jobs in the mines and better education for their children. Population in the southern West Virginia counties boomed. By 1906, there were 9,874 black students attending school in the state, the majority in Fayette, McDowell, Kanawha, Greenbrier, and Mercer counties. Black schools included 219 common, 42 grade schools, and 5 high schools and employed 310 African American teachers. These teachers were paid an average annual salary of $231.00, the same as white teachers at the time.\n\nThe first school for African Americans in Raleigh County was a one-room log structure built on Mills Branch in 1873. In nearby Summers County, the first black school was opened in 1878 with 15 pupils. Two years later, the first school for African American students in Fayette County was established at Quinnimont. These small community schools provided education only through the eighth grade, and for a school term of four to five months. Black students who were able to attend high school had to travel by train to larger population areas where an all-black high school existed.  Among the first African American high schools in the region were Stratton in Raleigh County, DuBois in Fayette County, and Lincoln in Summers County.\n\nStratton High School was established in 1918 over three centuries after the first black enslaved people arrived in Virginia in 1619. Stratton began as a two-room structure with nearly 80 students. In 1938, a two-story brick building with a gymnasium and auditorium was constructed. Considered the most up-to-date black high school in the state, it operated until 1967, when its students were integrated into the all-white Woodrow Wilson High School. Today, the building houses Stratton Elementary School.", "audioFileUrl": "https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/ADC9FF2D-B4A7-C493-6099040D7E8274D5.mp3"}, {"significance": "", "assetId": "3E7844BF-F8F3-4E58-9F1D-15D880D61EBC", "assetName": "John Henry Park, Talcott, WV", "assetType": "places", "id": "ADE02341-E6CB-7FB0-DBB099888574E19E", "ordinal": "15", "directionsToNextStop": "Second Baptist Church, Hinton\nPhysical Address:\t210 James Street, Hinton, WV 25951\nGPS Coordinates:\tN37.672028\t-W80.889716\nFrom Talcott, take Hwy 3 West 8 miles to Hwy 107 at Hinton.

Many of these men were African Americans who migrated to West Virginia in search of jobs. Jobs on the railroad were labor intensive and low paying, required long hours, and were at times dangerous. \n\nRailroad workers primarily used shovels, wheelbarrows, mules, and black powder to move millions of tons of rock and dirt to prepare the railroad bed. Workers used axe and adz to cut and shape hundreds of trees into ties, bridge timbers, and lumber for railcars. They sweated in the hot summer sun and froze in the cold mountain winters as they worked to connect Tidewater Virginia with the Ohio Valley.\n\nAs the C&O Railway stretched westward along the Greenbrier River, The Legend of John Henry was born at Big Bend Mountain near Talcott, West Virginia. The Legend of John Henry is just that, a \u201clegend,\u201d and through the legend, John Henry became a symbol. He symbolized the many African Americans whose sweat and hard work built and maintained the rails across West Virginia. He was a symbol for the black workers who gave their lives in these dangerous occupations. The legend, as told through ballads and work songs, has kept the story of John Henry and the black railroad workers alive. \n\nIn February of 1870, workers began drilling the Great Bend Tunnel where the Greenbrier River makes a seven-mile meander around Big Bend Mountain. Over 800 men, many of them African American, cut a 6,450 foot-long tunnel through the mountain. The workers cut through layers of red shale, which tended to disintegrate when exposed to air, making the tunnel a dangerous place to work. Rock falls were common and death was always a possibility. At nearly a mile and one quarter long, the Great Bend Tunnel is the longest on the C&O Railway.\n\nThe process of building a tunnel in the 1870s was slow and difficult work. Holes were drilled into the layers of rock using a hand drill and hammer. Holes were then filled with powder and blasted in order to make the rock small enough to remove from the tunnel. The drill was held by a \u201cshaker\u201d who turned it slightly after each blow and gave it a shake to flip the rock dust out of the hole.  The \u201csteel driver\u201d swung the hammer as hard and as often as he could, pounding the drill into the rock. \n\nAs the story goes, John Henry was hired as a steel driver for the railroad. Later, the railroad company brought in a steam drill to speed up work on the tunnel. It was said that the steam drill could drill faster than any man. The challenge was on, \u201cman against machine.\u201d John Henry was known as the strongest, the fastest, and the most powerful man working on the railroad. He went up against the steam drill to prove that the black worker could drill a hole through the rock farther and faster than the drill could. Using two 10-pound hammers, one in each hand, he pounded the drill so fast and so hard that he drilled a 14-foot hole into the rock. The legend says that the drill was only able to drill nine feet. John Henry beat the steam drill and later died of exhaustion. \n\nThe Great Bend Tunnel was completed on September 12, 1872, and remained in service until 1974. The tunnel and the man have been cemented into the annals of time through The Ballad of John Henry. The song tells of a boy born with a \"hammer in his hand.\u201d It tells of a man who worked as a steel driver during the construction of the Great Bend Tunnel. It tells us that this man took a hammer in each hand to face down a steam-powered drilling machine. John Henry promised, \"If I can't beat this steam drill down, I'll die with this hammer in my hand!\" At the Great Bend Tunnel, John Henry became one of the world\u2019s great folk heroes.", "audioFileUrl": "https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/ADD8BF4F-FA92-BA93-F0A7C71DB6EBF3A0.mp3"}, {"significance": "", "assetId": "D02127FF-7F08-4C73-A441-8B29A1EB05E9", "assetName": "Second Baptist Church, Hinton, WV", "assetType": "places", "id": "ADEDD2F2-01B8-CE1B-FB97BB9D4509B2F0", "ordinal": "16", "directionsToNextStop": "", "audioTranscript": "Segregation of African Americans\nWritten by:\tMichael Burk\nNarrated by:\tJoshua Flynn\n\nAfrican Americans living in West Virginia after the Civil War experienced an unusual social and racial environment. From the 1870s through the 1950s, thousands of African Americans migrated to the state in search of jobs. Upon their arrival, they were met with segregation and discrimination, but also with economic, political, and educational opportunities that had been denied them in other southern states. They preferred West Virginia because it provided them the right to vote and educate their children. \n\nThey came to live in communities which were not suppressed by racist politics and the constraints of Jim Crow laws. Just across the state line in Virginia, Jim Crow laws forced African Americans to use segregated transportation and granted them no voting rights. In West Virginia, African Americans were able to send their children to publicly-funded schools. They could ride on the same bus as white people. They were able to participate in local politics. Through their vote, they were able to elect African Americans to local school boards, law enforcement offices, city councils, and the state legislature.\n\nSegregation and racism was present in other ways. It existed in coal camps and railroad towns, in the mines, and on the railroad. Black and white residents lived in different neighborhoods, worshiped in separate churches, and attended segregated schools. Many towns had a \u201cwhite neighborhood\u201d and a \u201cblack neighborhood\u201d that separated where residents lived. Housing for African Americans was often inferior and located in the less desirable part of town. The section of town where black residents lived was on the far end of town away from the company store and other amenities. Helen Powell relates that in the Collins Hill area of Glen Jean, the \u201cblack section\u201d did not have running water like the \u201cwhite section\u201d did. \n\nAfrican American workers faced racism on the job as well. On the railroad, there were white-only jobs, the engineers, conductors, and supervisors. Black workers did jobs that included porters, baggage handlers, and track crews. In the mines, Whites were almost exclusively hired as supervisors, fire bosses, and motormen.  African Americans were hired into jobs as coal loaders and mule handlers which were more labor intensive positions. Even though segregation prevailed, black miners were offered the same type of housing, rental rates, and equal wages as white miners. Black and white miners typically intermingled while eating lunch, gathering their equipment, and riding shaft elevators and underground rail cars. However, they showered and changed in segregated bath houses and went home to separate neighborhoods. \n\nAfrican Americans were also subjected to segregation in seeing a movie, eating at a restaurant, attending school, or staying at a hotel. There were hotels for white patrons and hotels for black patrons. At the theater, black movie goers had to sit in the balcony or in areas away from the white movie goers. African Americans were provided separate company-owned recreation facilities. One gentleman recalls: \n\n\u201cOur communities were segregated and I lived in a small coal camp. We grew up basically playing ball together every day. We used to have segregated competitions a lot of times. The Blacks would play the Whites in a Sunday afternoon football game. All of us would meet down at the ball field at two o clock and the Blacks would play the Whites.\n\nAfrican-American life was shaped by more than segregation and discrimination. Black people drew on their cultural traditions and their power at the ballot box to create strong communities. They invested in their churches, fraternal and professional organizations and communities. These provided a sense of belonging, opportunities for leadership, and means for spiritual and material improvement. Schools became vital institutions in the African-American community. They did more than educate and socialize black children. They provided leadership and social opportunities for both students and adults within the African American community. Although black and white residents lived in separate neighborhoods and patronized segregated restaurants and theaters, they did work closely in the mines and sat side-by-side on public transportation.", "audioFileUrl": "https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/ADED4260-C583-005F-05775FF12468DC83.mp3"}, {"significance": "", "assetId": "0011F735-9993-48A0-8C3E-E66745EEE5D9", "assetName": "Hinton Depot", "assetType": "places", "id": "ADFCA580-0F11-5746-5B2F2C60B973321A", "ordinal": "17", "directionsToNextStop": "Quinnimont Missionary Baptist Church\nPhysical Address:\tStanaford Road (Highway 41), Prince, WV 25907\nGPS Coordinates:\tN37.855641\t-W81.045615\nFrom the Hinton Depot, travel up Second Avenue to Temple Street (Hwy 20) and turn left.

Without big industry, the region was sparsely populated and the workforce was small. During the late 1800s, the construction of railroads through southern West Virginia created the need for a much larger workforce. Recruitment by the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway Company and others brought thousands of African Americans to build and maintain their railroads. As the railroads opened up the large coal fields of Central Appalachia, even more African Americans came to fill hundreds of coal mining jobs.\n\nFor a period of about sixty years, starting in 1870, African Americans migrated to West Virginia through major rail centers like Hinton. They came in search of jobs as well as economic and political opportunities denied them in other states. They also came to escape Jim Crow laws that segregated them and denied them voting rights. They came because West Virginia provided better education opportunities for their children. \n\nIn 1870, there were nearly 18,000 African Americans living in West Virginia.  By 1910, the black population had grown to over 64,000 residents and eventually reached a high of 115,000. Then came the Great Depression of the 1930s. During these years, African Americans suffered from high unemployment and hard times in West Virginia. With the advent of World War II, new technologies and mechanization transformed the coal industry. These technologies doubled coal production and vastly cut the need for manpower. Coal companies were also reluctant to train and use Blacks workers to operate the new machinery. This lead to substantial layoffs of black coal miners. The result of these events stimulated a massive out-migration by African Americans in the post-war years\n\nBetween 1930 and 1980, the number of African-American coal miners fell from 22,000 to less than 1,500. By the end of the 20th century, black miners had dropped to less than three percent of West Virginia\u2019s work force. African Americans left West Virginia for the same reasons they came almost 150 years earlier, to find better jobs and economic opportunities elsewhere.", "audioFileUrl": "https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/ADF1A079-F46D-20B2-644159359BE1C04E.mp3"}], "images": [{"credit": "Camp Washington Carver", "crops": [{"aspectRatio": 1.78, "url": "https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/primary/AE2CFF14-B68A-0E9C-ADCEF845AF3D2A6B.jpg"}, {"aspectRatio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/secondary/AE2CFF14-B68A-0E9C-ADCEF845AF3D2A6B.jpg"}], "title": "Camp Washington Carver", "altText": "campers raise a flag in front of a camp lodge", "caption": "Campers at Camp Washington raise the flag", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/AE2CFF14-B68A-0E9C-ADCEF845AF3D2A6B.jpg"}]}

What makes this desert different from the Great Basin\nDesert to our north, Mojave to our west or the Chihuahuan to our east? Many factors make the Sonoran Desert unique. Our winters are mostly frost-free, and there are two rainfall periods, one in the winter/spring and another in July and August.

This olive green shrub you see all around you is one of the most drought-tolerant plants in North America. Long after the soil is too dry for most species, creosote still manages to absorb water. Its adaptations allow it to survive without water for two years before completely dying. \n\nThis supple plant sports small yellow blossoms in the spring and summer. It may occasionally bloom during other times of the year if rainfall is sufficient. The seeds are gray fuzzy balls that resemble droplets of water hanging from the branches. The waxy coating on creosote\u2019s leaves protects the plant from excessive water loss. Locals often say that the Sonoran Desert \u201csmells like rain\u201d because of the intoxicating aroma the leaves give off during a rain storm or on a foggy winter morning. \n\nCreosote is found abundantly, all over the southwest, in three deserts \u2013 the Chihuahuan, Mojave and Sonoran. It also is very long-lived, creating clonal colonies; one found in California is believed to be over 10,000 years old and is considered one of the oldest single living organisms on the planet. \n\nCreosote is useful to many desert species. The kangaroo rat likes to build its nest within the roots of the creosote bush. The seeds are a life source to many jackrabbits.

It is certainly the tallest and largest cactus in the United States, growing as high as 50 feet and weighing several tons. It can live to be 200 years old. In Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument we think that these cacti flower for the first time at approximately 65 years of age and might produce their first arms at around 90. Of course there is no way to know exactly how old a saguaro is (it doesn\u2019t create growth rings like a tree). What we know comes from averaging data from hundreds of cacti all across the Sonoran Desert. Cacti living in washes or over by Tucson, where the water is more abundant, grow faster. Cacti growing in the valley flats, where water is scarce, can live their whole lives and never have the resources to support arm growth. A saguaro is entirely dependent on location and rainfall, as well as the ability of its shallow roots to suck up as much rain as possible to store in its spongy flesh. \n  \nSaguaros have adapted to the Sonoran Desert. They arrived in the region only 8,000 years ago, more recently than humans. Humans living here adapted their lives to include, even revere, the giant cactus. The Tohono O\u2019odham have strong cultural ties to the saguaro. The first saguaro fruit harvest coincides with the Tohono O\u2019odham New Year, when the summer monsoon rains fall on the parched desert floor. The O\u2019odham use woody ribs of dead saguaros to create a tool, called a ku-pit, enabling them to reach the fruit clustered at the tops of the arms and crowns of the cacti. \n  \nThe timing of the fruit ripening is impressive. Flowers appear in May and June when the desert is at its hottest and driest. The nectar is the only moisture in town, attracting important pollinators like birds and bats. The fruits ripen in July, in time for many animals to eat the delicious red fruits and transport thousands of seeds to new homes. Once the seeds are spread and the monsoon rains start, those seeds have the chance to grow into new giant saguaro. \n \nEven with all of the saguaro\u2019s adaptations to capture and conserve water, without the help of other species it would not survive here at all.

Roosevelt and protects most of the natural habitat of the organ pipe cactus within the United States. While commonly found in the southern sections of the Sonoran Desert, these cacti are rare north of the US-Mexico border but have adapted to life in the monument. Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument experiences only a few frosty nights a year, allowing the cacti to stay warm and flourish like their Mexican neighbors. Notice how these plants to your left are standing on the south-facing slopes with little vegetation near them. Organ pipe cacti crave the sun\u2019s heat and do not require nurse plants. At night the rocks surrounding the plant release heat stored during the day, thus keeping the plants from freezing. \n \nIn June and July, flowers and fruits cover the arms of these columnar cacti. The flowers only open at night, closing for good in the early morning light to keep water loss at a minimum. These lavender-tinged white flowers emit a strong fragrance to attract lesser long-nosed bats. Each summer these bats migrate from Mexico to feast on flower nectar and the pregnant females give birth and nurse their young. They congregate at Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, roosting within the monument\u2019s caves, buildings and historical structures, such as abandoned mines, rock shelters and old ranch houses.

A small settlement stood on the edges of this wash, inhabited from late spring through the fall. Hohokam family-groups spent the hot dry foresummer (May, June and July) planting rows of drought-tolerant crops: corn, tepary beans and squash. Irrigation ditches were dug between the rows and down into the wash below. When the monsoon rains of August began to pour onto the parched earth, the water collected in washes and flash-flooding occurred. \n \nDams were built in strategic places to divert the floodwaters into irrigation ditches where the water would be most useful.

Just below the ridge, the upper portion of Diablo Wash emerges from a steep canyon. Looking west from the ridge, the large, dark double summit of Twin Peaks rises above the Kris Eggle Visitor Center. The more distant craggy Cubabi Mountains to the south lie just beyond the town of Sonoyta, Mexico. Behind the Cubabis lies Reserva de la Biosfera El Pinacate y Gran Desierto de Altar or El Pinacate to the locals.

As the land was stretched, vast areas sank and formed broad valleys. These valleys were intersected by uplifted blocks of land, creating today\u2019s Ajo Range. Other mountain chains appeared one after the other as far as the eye could see. As the surface was slowly deformed, volcanoes, lava flows, and falling volcanic ash accumulated and resulted in the colorful layers of rock that are revealed all around you. \n\nThe pink and chocolate-colored rock is rhyolite, formed from solidification of a slow moving, thick lava flow. The light brown or tan rock layers, called tuff, is volcanic ash turned to stone. Over time, the mountains have been worn down and the valleys filled by rock and debris from the powerful effect of water cutting through and carrying away layers of solid rock.", "audioFileUrl": "https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/7A6EC836-C656-A6F6-6BEF55542FC3D2C6.mp3"}, {"significance": "", "assetId": "C9810A06-D1F2-4CA6-9D53-A2AC5CE21FC4", "assetName": "Ajo Mountain Drive Stop 10", "assetType": "places", "id": "4CE93337-B830-63BC-3241BB34C3C688EE", "ordinal": "10", "directionsToNextStop": "Continue 2.7 miles (4.3 km) along Ajo Mountain Drive to reach Stop 11.", "audioTranscript": "Stop 10 \n\nThe Cooler Climate of Canyon Country\nThe Ajo Mountains receive more rain than any other part of the monument and have cooler summer weather.

Their hooves have adapted to allow them to cling to rocky slopes and steep ravines. The mountain environment is especially attractive to turkey vultures, eagles and ravens that nest in the canyons and ride the air currents that canyons provide. Caves and rock shelters within the canyon walls are also great roosting places for bats.

It even grows on the highest peak in the monument, Mount Ajo, which is on your left and marks the boundary between the monument and the Tohono O\u2019odham Nation. Archeologists have discovered agave-roasting pits in the high country of Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument. These pits are associated with the Hohokam who cultivated agave for ceremonial purposes. Why were the Hohokam at the top of the Ajo Range? \n\nArcheologists believe that the Hohokam tradition was to move to the high country canyons after fall harvest in the valleys. Canyons, like Estes Canyon below and to your left, served as winter homes and watchmen were located at the tops of mountains to guard the community against raiders. The Tohono O\u2019odham also used these canyons as winter homes. They were likely hunting mammals. These higher elevations also afforded a chance to catch more water. Snow and rain were more likely in the mountains. It is easy to imagine the people of the past making their way on foot up that steep rugged hill. The promise of water in dependable tinajas, natural catchments in the rock that hold rain water, were their only source of water for miles. The Hohokam and the Tohono O\u2019odham adapted to the desert by moving biannually to find food and water. Their migratory routes were always associated with tinajas, springs or other water sources and are still visible in the monument today.\n\nAhead is Estes Canyon, the midpoint of the Ajo Mountain Drive. Here you will find a ramada with picnic tables and restrooms. A loop trail leads into Estes Canyon and then climbs onto a ridge. It returns down through the foothills back to the parking area. Halfway around the loop a short spur trail climbs to Bull Pasture, which early ranchers used for their cattle. From the Bull Pasture Viewpoint hikers have a stunning view of Mount Ajo, the highest peak in the monument at 4,808 feet (1466 m).

Tiny flowers grow on the male plants, producing pollen that is wind-deposited onto female plants. The female plants then produce an acorn-shaped seed in summer. These shrubs have adapted to the extreme desert heat by keeping their leaf edges facing the harsh midday sun, thus reducing evaporation of precious water from broad, flat leaf surfaces.\n\nThe foliage provides year-round browse for animals like bighorn sheep and whitetail deer.

The fruit is high in carbohydrates and attracts many different herbivores. The mesquite adapted seed dispersal so that when seedpods were eaten in great quantities, they were dispersed across the land. Rabbits, packrats, javelina and coyote all depend on the seasonal seedpods for food. These animals, and others, help to scatter the mesquite seeds across the desert. \n\nIn the 1500s, missionaries introduced the cow, which allowed for even greater seed dispersal. Cattle no longer range in the monument but the abundance of mesquite serves as a reminder of their presence. \n\nOften called the \u201cTree of Life\u201d, many desert-dwellers owe their survival to the mesquite tree. The seeds were, and still are, ground into flour used for breads. These seeds have more protein than soybeans and were a major food source for the Tohono O\u2019odham. \n\nAnother tree that sustains life in the desert is the palo verde. With its green trunk and branches, the palo verde has a very clever way of conserving moisture. By not having leaves during the hot season, it can photosynthesize and respire (that is to create energy and breathe) through its trunk, thus conserving water. \n\nThe palo verde can also serve as a nurse tree. Saguaro seeds need shelter from a nurse plant such as a creosote or palo verde tree. These plants protect the young cactus from sunburn, torrential floods and the occasional winter frosts. Nurse trees such as the palo verde, mesquite and ironwood even fertilize the young cacti as the trees fix nitrogen from the air into the soil for themselves. The young cactus is \u201cnursed\u201d as it grows up tall and strong, spreading its shallow root system out to collect rain as it falls. This is not good news for the nurse plant. As the cactus roots spread only 3-4 inches below the surface of the soil, what started as a shelter becomes a battlefield for water. The saguaro proves victorious. Many of the monument\u2019s larger saguaros are surrounded by remains of their dead nurse trees.", "audioFileUrl": "https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/4D04A661-EBDF-57D6-E0A3C5E2DFCE0CA7.mp3"}, {"significance": "", "assetId": "68DE47F0-5DAB-4CCB-B3D9-3C05815EC7ED", "assetName": "Ajo Mountain Drive Stop 14", "assetType": "places", "id": "4D1656ED-9FCE-2C27-B7FB593FF23BF2EB", "ordinal": "14", "directionsToNextStop": "Continue 0.4 miles (0.6 km) along Ajo Mountain Drive to reach Stop 15.", "audioTranscript": "Stop 14 \n\nTraveling in the Footsteps of History\n\nIn the 1680s, Father Eusebio Francisco Kino arrived with orders to establish missions throughout the region. He worked with the O\u2019odham people, teaching them about cattle grazing and learning human migratory routes in return. Padre Kino\u2019s expedition mapped the region, recording invaluable water sources and ancient pathways. The expedition quickly adapted to the region, learning that trails must be near water, among high mountains and through passes. Without this knowledge, Kino\u2019s expedition and the many people that have come since would surely have perished. \n\nMany of the maps that Padre Kino created and the names he placed on them are still in use. Looking at a map of the monument today, one can immerse oneself in the history and geology of the region. Bull Pasture gets its name from the monuments\u2019 ranching era; Twin Peaks is named for its double-peaked appearance; Pinkley Peak commemorates Frank Pinkley, Superintendent of Southwestern National Monuments 1923 \u2013 1940. Behind each name is a story. \nThe Diaz Mountains are named for Captain Melchior Diaz, leader of a 15 member group in the Coronado expedition 1539-1542. In January 1541, when the expedition was close to here, Diaz suffered a freak accident and was mortally wounded. Diaz\u2019s men had no choice but to abandon any further explorations.

It may look as if this plant is a cactus because of its spines, but don\u2019t be fooled, it is not a cactus! This plant belongs to the Candlewood Family and is the only representative of this family in the United States. It\u2019s cousin, the boojum tree, grows mainly in Baja California, Mexico, and has been described as looking like an upside down carrot. These plants store water in their roots and stems. In drier times they shed their leaves and resemble long spiny sticks. Once the rain comes they restore just as if there was never a dry spell. Each spring leaves come out and brilliant orange-red flowers bloom at the ends of the stems. These flowers attract hummingbirds to pollinate the plant and are vital to the ocotillo\u2019s survival. The nectar found within each tubular flower is a vital energy source, crucial to the hummingbird\u2019s survival during its long and arduous migration. This mutually beneficial relationship is another example of adaptation to the desert environment. \n\nThese plants are not only beautiful but useful as well. Ocotillos are resilient and have been used for roofs and living fences by the Tohono O\u2019odham and other people in the area.

The spines are barbed and hook into the coat or flesh of the passer-by and the cholla joint is transported to a new location. If the conditions are favorable where it falls, the cholla joint might grow into a new plant.

These spines are an adaptation to the desert sun; they create shade for the cholla itself, reducing its exposure to the sun. Teddy bear cholla reproduce in the same manner as many chain-fruit cholla; by breaking off joints and rooting them into the ground. This means that all the cacti you see before you may have come from one plant that was dropped off in this area by an animal that brushed by another teddy bear cholla along his path. According to botanists, it is very possible that all the teddy bear cholla in the United States come from a single strain. \n\nPackrats will take the cholla joints to make a very protective nest called a midden.

Folks worked in the orange groves, the bee apiaries, and in vegetable gardens. They spent time with loved ones and enjoyed the bounty that the waters of the lagoon had to offer. In 1895 and 1900 there were hard freezes that killed the orange groves. Change continued with the coming of the railroad to the mainland. Boat transport was abandoned, isolating the village. Fairview became a backwater town that receded into the hammock. After 1910 Florida became popular as a wintering place for the wealthy, and Fairview became known as Eldora. Imagine wintering here with hunting, fishing, and trips to the beach by families that traveled to escape the cold northern winters: the original snowbirds. By the 1930s the Great Depression brought years of hard times, decline and neglect to Eldora. The Eldora State House, the last remaining home of this era, fell to disrepair. But her story was not over. In the the 1980s the Friends of Canaveral began a ten year restoration project. Thanks to their hard work, you can enjoy the Eldora State House in its full splendor today.

Harry Truman didn\u2019t move in here until he was an adult, but he would have known of the house ever since he was a little kid.  His family came to Independence in 1890 when he was six.  \n\nThe house you\u2019re looking at, the one we now call the Truman home, was originally called the Gates\u2019 home.  Bess Truman\u2019s maternal grandfather, George Porterfield Gates, built it.  It was finished as you see it now in 1885.  Bess moved into her grandfather\u2019s home in 1904 with her three brothers and her mother.  Bess was 19 years old at the time.  \n\nHarry moved in after Bess and he got married in 1919.  They ended up staying here the rest of their lives\u2014before, during, and after he was the president of the United States.  Harry and Bess Truman knew where they were going to go when they left the White House.  A reporter at a press conference asked President Truman if he planned to return to Independence after he left the White House, and Truman said, \u201cCertainly.  That\u2019s my home.\u201d  \n\nThe Trumans had roots and those roots went deep.  Just within this one block you\u2019re going to walk around, you\u2019ll see where they first met, where they graduated from school, where their courtship started, where their daughter Margaret went to school, where they voted for Harry for president, where they got their hair cut, \u2014all this in one block.  These people had a real sense of \u201ccommunity.\u201d  \n\nTruman would have seen these buildings on a regular basis, too, because he liked to take walks around his hometown.  He didn\u2019t have a set route, but diary entries and photographs show that, no matter where you walk around here, he probably walked there before you.  He walked 120 steps a minute.  He learned that pace in the military.  He wasn\u2019t just moseying along; he was walking for his health.  He wrote, \u201cAfter you are fifty years old, this is the best exercise you can take.\u201d He also wrote, \u201cOf course, some aging exhibitionists try to prove they can play tennis, handball, or anything else they did when they were eighteen.  And every once in a while, one of them falls dead of a heart attack.  I say that\u2019s not for me.\u201d \n\nYou, however, do not have to walk 120 steps a minute.

Stand where you can see the garage behind the Truman home; that was originally the barn.  The building goes back to the 1870s.  But, just because there was a barn here doesn\u2019t mean any of these houses you see anywhere around here were ever out in the country.  In fact, the amount of land you see around the Truman home now is about all there ever was.  But before folks had refrigerators and such, lots of folks had their own milk cow, chickens for eggs, horses to get around, and a garden.  \n\nThe garden for the Truman home (or the Gates home as it would have then been known) was where the two Wallace boys' homes are now.  There would have also been a little bit of pasture for the animals.  \n\nWhen the boys got married, their grandfather Gates gave them each a 50\u2019 strip of land to build their houses on.  So, George and Frank ended up living right behind their grandfather\u2019s house.  \n\nBess\u2019s brothers were only a few years younger than she was, so during the time Harry and Bess were dating, George and Frank were also dating the girls they would eventually marry.  This meant they all hung out together, went on dates together, picnics, walks, sometimes to plays or concerts in Kansas City\u2014they all knew each other and were friends.  \n\nBess\u2019s youngest brother, Fred, was going to build a third home in the yard, but never got around to it.  So, when he got married, his wife moved into the big house, and they had two kids while there were living here.  So, you had that family, plus the Trumans, living in the big house, and then these boys and their wives out back, who were up at the big house for supper a lot\u2014all in all, Harry Truman knew these folks most of his life, but he also ended up living with all of them.  Both these homes, now, are part of Harry S Truman National Historic Site.  We use them for offices.  \n\nAt the time Bess moved into her grandfather\u2019s home, her younger brothers were still in school, and they only had to walk a block to get there.  In fact, it was the same school from which their older sister, Bess, and their future brother-in-law Harry Truman, both graduated back in 1901.  It was right at the other end of the block.

The building\u2019s been altered some over the years since most of the original building burned in 1939, but it\u2019s looked the way it does not pretty much since 1940.  There really isn\u2019t much left of the building Harry and Bess graduated from, but Margaret Truman would have gone to school here.  By that time, a new high school had been built and this was building was called Palmer Junior High.  It was named after Professor W. L. C. Palmer, whose wife, Ardelia, taught Latin to Harry and Bess when they were kids.  \n\nHarry Truman gave an interview on one for the first walks he took after he retired from the White House.  About this building, he said, \u201cThere\u2019s our new high school.  The old one where I went to school burned down, and all the records burned with it.  Some people have the idea I never went to school at all.  Now, with the records gone, I\u2019d be kind of hard put to it to prove I really did.\u201d  He went on to say, \u201cOf course, I could refer them to Mrs. Ardelia Palmer.  She was my teacher in high school and still lives here in Independence.\u201d  In fact, if you look north across Truman Road, right beyond the Baptist Church playground, you can see a yellow house with white trim about halfway up the block on Pleasant Street.  That\u2019s where Mrs. Palmer lived.  \n\nHarry Truman knew who he was going to see when he came back from the White House; it would be people he\u2019d known\u2014and who\u2019d known him\u2014for years.  If he\u2019d come back from the White House acting like he thought he was a big shot for having been the president, he probably would have looked a little foolish to some of these people, especially those that had known him since he was a little kid running around.  \n\nNow, think about all the kids that went to school here after him.  They had a lot to live up to.  On election day they were allowed to come out on the front sidewalk and watch the Memorial Building right across the street because, even though Truman was the president, he\u2019d come back to Independence to vote and the polls were in the Memorial Building, so all the kids would get to see their school\u2019s most famous alumni coming out of the polls after voting for himself.  \n\nCross the street, walk down around to the front of the Memorial Building on the corner of Pleasant and Maple Streets and take a look.", "audioFileUrl": "https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/6AE0F5B6-FFB2-4CDD-BE213B51B7768632.mp3"}, {"significance": "Location of an official presidential press conference and location where Harry Truman voted.", "assetId": "21B1C478-7189-45DA-B5E3-D789D703B4C4", "assetName": "World War I Memorial Building", "assetType": "places", "id": "7612F081-AFE4-3F00-A454FFB9729542D8", "ordinal": "4", "directionsToNextStop": "Accross Maple from the Truman Memorial building is the Crown Beauty Parlor.", "audioTranscript": "This is the Soldiers\u2019 and Sailors\u2019 Memorial Building, sometimes called the World War I Memorial Building.

This building was also the place that Truman held his only official presidential press conference in Independence.  \n\nThis building was the center of civic life in the community.  Over the years, the building served as the gathering place for hundreds of community events, including fraternal and charitable club meetings, concerts and sports events, political and cultural gatherings, graduations, and funeral services for notable Independence civic leaders.  \n\nThis building was the heart of the town.  And these people knew each other.  When you walked in here, you were going to know everyone else.  And people expected certain things from each other.  These expectations would have been the kind of things that folks would have learned as kids \u2013 the kind of behavior that makes a community work \u2013 the old standards, like honesty is the best policy.  Anything worthwhile requires effort.  Children are a reflection of their parents.  Keep your word.  Don\u2019t get too big for your britches.  Never forget a friend.  Truman said later, \u201cIn those days, right was right and wrong was wrong and you didn\u2019t have to talk about it.\u201d  As David McCullough wrote in his Truman biography, these \u201cwere more than words-to-the-wise, they were bedrock, as clearly established, as integral to the way of life\u2026as were the very landmarks of the community, its schools, church steeples, and courthouse.\u201d  \n\nMr. Truman wrote about voting here in 1952.  He was still in the White House, but only for another couple of months: \u201cI voted early,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbefore breakfast, in the Memorial Hall at Independence, where I had been voting for more than three decades.  It is a short walk from my home.  But this voting was a new experience.  It was one of the few times in more than thirty years that I was marking a ballot on which my name did not appear as a candidate for some office.  Mrs. Truman and Margaret walked along with me to the polls, and we thought of the happy prospect of returning to the peace and quiet of our home in Independence.\u201d  Part of returning to private life, though, meant giving up some of the benefits of the presidency.  \n\nWhen Truman left office in 1953, there still was no pension or Secret Service protection for retired presidents.  Those came later, and Truman started to get them once they were available.  But for the first several years of his retirement, he was truly a private citizen and had to take care of the same things all the rest of us have to do, such as going to the store or\u2026 getting a haircut, for instance.  \n\nThe place where Harry and Bess got their hair cut is right across the street at Number 417 West Maple.", "audioFileUrl": ""}, {"significance": "The barber/beautician for Mr. & Mrs. Truman", "assetId": "019713E0-75A1-4B21-ACFB-1DF7B1722395", "assetName": "Crown Beauty Parlor", "assetType": "places", "id": "76258075-9064-E0CC-67110F0151888345", "ordinal": "5", "directionsToNextStop": "Take Maple west back to Pleasant Street.

And like a lot of barbers and beauticians, the Millers got to know all their clients pretty well, including their presidential ones.  Folks coming in here would have known each other.  Doris did the hair of Bess\u2019s sisters-in-law, too.  Margaret Truman would come in sometimes if she happened to be in town visiting her parents.  Doris described it as, \u201cOh, this little shop, you know, is very homey and everybody was passing around their favorite recipes and discussions of that sort, you know.\u201d  She said Mrs. Truman always had a book to read and \u201cshe always inquired about our family and of course our children.\u201d  \n\nThere\u2019s a good story about Harry Truman and one of the Miller\u2019s daughters.  The girl, JoAnn, was going to Palmer Jr. High, right across the street there, and JoAnn came home one afternoon from school \u2013 this would probably have been in 1961 \u2013 and tells her mother that she can get extra credit for finding out about a constitutional amendment that was going to be passed.  And she wants to call up the former president because she figures that if anybody around here knew about something like that, it\u2019d probably be him.  Doris had the Truman's phone number, because hairdressers sometimes need to call their clients in case something comes up concerning an appointment or something.  But, still, she was a little hesitant just to call up the president at home.  JoAnn says, though, that there\u2019s no way to find out.  Remember, there\u2019s no internet, and for current events, you\u2019ve got the paper and the radio, and maybe TV, but there\u2019s a lot of information that simply isn\u2019t available like it would be now.  So, Doris let JoAnn call the Trumans and Bess answered the phone.  Bess tells Harry that it\u2019s JoAnn and she wanted to know about an amendment.  And he said, \u201ctell JoAnn to call me in the morning at the library.  I\u2019ll call Sam Rayburn [the Speaker of the House] and I\u2019ll find out.\u201d  So, she did.  And she was the only one that got the extra credit.  Doris said, \u201cHe would have done that for any child that was interested, you know.

We were Baptists, but the Presbyterian preacher was so nice my folks let me go to Sunday School with him.  Lucky thing they did, too, because that\u2019s where I first met Bess.

She\u2019d let him carry her books home from school sometimes and, oh boy, that\u2019d just make his day, but he worshiped her from afar; she had no idea how he felt at the time, so they weren\u2019t close friends by any means.  Still, they knew each other almost their entire lives.  \n\nEven though Harry attended Sunday School here, he never joined the Presbyterian church.  This is one of the reasons he and Bess didn\u2019t associate socially more often when they were young.  In Independence, even though everybody knew each other, there was a strict social echelon based on religious affiliation, even more so than on wealth.  (As a matter of fact, Harry Truman\u2019s father had between 30-40 thousand dollars at the time Harry graduated from high school; some people have the idea Harry Truman grew up poor, but that\u2019s not really true.)  But they were Baptists.  The Presbyterians, like Bess\u2019s family, were at the top of the list, whereas the Baptists were more down near the middle.  Much later, after everybody got famous, a reporter asked one of Bess\u2019s childhood friends if Harry had hung out with them when they were kids, and the friend said, \u201cNo, no.  Harry was a Baptist!\u201d  \n\nEven though Bess was raised a Presbyterian, when the Trumans were married, it was in the Episcopal Church.  There\u2019s a variety of stories as to what happened exactly but it seems to have something to do with the Presbyterian minister marrying a woman who was divorced.  This is back in 1901, the year Harry and Bess graduated from high school, and apparently, this was kind of scandalous for the times.  Whether Bess was upset by this, or whether she was upset with the others who were upset isn\u2019t clear, but for whatever reason, her and her brother Frank started attending Trinity Episcopal Church, which is a few blocks from here.  That\u2019s why Harry and Bess were married at the Episcopal church.  \n\nBess\u2019s grandparents, the Gates\u2019s, stayed with the Presbyterian church.  Their roots in the church were too deep to be pulled up.  Bess\u2019s grandfather, George Porterfield Gates was one of the town\u2019s leading citizens and he was not going to change churches.  \n\nHis money came from a flour mill located a few blocks to the south that he was part owner of.  He was a very respectable man, and his home was in a very respectable neighborhood.  \n\nThere was more than one successful businessman living on Maple Street.

It was built in the 1890s.  Anton Bundschu was the owner of Bundschu's Department Store about four blocks east up on the town square.  Bundschu\u2019s was the largest department store in the city at the time.  The Trumans, Gates, and Wallace families would have been among the many Independence residents who patronized Bundschu's Department Store.  \n\nAnton\u2019s son, Henry Bundschu, owned the house after his parents died.  Henry was a long-time friend of Harry Truman.  Doris Miller, Bess Truman\u2019s hairdresser, referred to Henry Bundschu as the \u201cmost staunch Republican we had on our street.\u201d  But Doris remembered Mr. Truman and Mr. Bundschu sitting in her husband George\u2019s barbershop together, leaving \u201carm-in-arm, going down the street\u201d towards their homes \u201cjust a\u2019 chatting.\u201d  So, this is another example of how all these people were connected.  \n\nThey knew each other, they worked together, they patronized each other\u2019s businesses, their families had known each other for years \u2013 in fact, a bunch of them were related; Bess Truman\u2019s sister-in-law, Natalie Wallace, was Henry Bundschu\u2019s cousin.  There was a real sense of continuity here that gave life a feeling of stability.  \n\nSo, this is something to think about: Harry Truman was the president of the United States for almost eight full years.  He and Joseph Stalin and Winston Churchill made the decision as to what to do with Europe after World War II, Truman launched the Truman Doctrine, which kept Greece and Turkey out of the Soviet Union.  He was the first world leader to recognize the new nation of Israel, he established the CIA and the Department of Defense and the Air Force.  He dropped the atomic bomb.  He led us to war in Korea, he fired General Douglas MacArthur.  And he did more for civil rights than any president since Abraham Lincoln.  \n\nHaving a home like Independence and knowing that stability still existed in a world like that might have given him a faith that, regardless of how chaotic things might seem, no matter how out of control the world might appear, there still were places and people and situations that one could count on.  There were safe places.  And if it could happen here, maybe it could happen in other places.  \n\nMaybe Independence gave Harry Truman the faith to keep trying to make the world a better place rather than just give up on it, because, maybe, he might be able to actually do it.  Whether he was right about that, I don\u2019t know.  And it didn\u2019t mean he thought every place in the world ought to be just like Independence, Missouri, either.  The world\u2019s full of different kinds of people and the lifestyle one group prefers may not be anything like what another group would prefer.  But the idea that everyone might eventually live in a world where they felt safe and secure, he really seemed to believe.  \n\nHarry Truman was a practical idealist.  Knowing that is kind of important if you\u2019re trying to understand the kind of president he was.  He knew the world wasn\u2019t perfect and he knew it probably never would be, but still, it didn\u2019t hurt to try to make it better.  \n\nThe \u201cstaunch Republican\u201d Henry Bundschu once made the comment, \u201cI used to say that Harry Truman lived around the corner from me; now there isn\u2019t a day goes by that I don\u2019t tell myself \u2018you live around the corner from Harry Truman and don\u2019t you ever forget it.\u2019\u201d  \n\nBuildings and people weren\u2019t the only touchstones Harry Truman had in on this block, though.

It\u2019s not the house that important, though, so much as the big tree in the front yard.  It\u2019s a Gingko tree.  \n\nOn his morning walks down Maple, Harry Truman often stopped to admire and speak to this tree.  He was overheard saying \"you\u2019re doing a good job,\" and he\u2019d reach out and pat it.  Since we\u2019ve been talking about stability and consistency, it\u2019s kind of interesting that Truman picked out this particular tree to favor.  \n\nYou see, the Gingko tree is one of the oldest species of tree on the planet.  They come from China and can live for thousands of years.  They\u2019re resistant to drought, insects, disease, pollution \u2013 they\u2019re tough trees.  They have evolved almost not at all over the last 260 million years or so.  It\u2019s been called a living fossil.  Two hundred- and sixty-year-old fossils look exactly like the modern-day tree.

They wrote and produced plays and put on circuses for the adults, charging a dime to get in.  \n\nThe girls published a weekly newspaper, which lasted five weeks.  The highest selling issue carried a story about Margaret\u2019s Uncle Frank (who lived behind the Truman home, remember) bending over in the garden and splitting his pants.  Circulation skyrocketed with that issue because Frank tried to buy up the entire edition.  Margaret wrote, \u201cIt was in demand all over town!\u201d  \n\nAs Harry and Bess would have known, Independence was a good place to grow up.  Margaret, however, was not destined to spend her entire childhood in Independence.  \n\nWhen she was ten years old, Margaret said, \u201cWe packed our trunks and set out for that city which had hitherto been merely hearsay, a dot on the map in the geography book, a ten-letter word.\u201d  Her father had been elected to the United States Senate and they would be moving to Washington for at least part of the year.  Margaret would no longer be within \u201ccalling distance\u201d of the Allen girls.  \n\nMrs. Truman told a reporter, \u201cOh course I\u2019m thrilled to be going to Washington, but I have spent all my life here on Delaware Street and it will be a change.  I was born on Delaware Street and was married to Harry here sixteen years ago when he came back from the World War.

So, the routine was that all the Trumans would go to Washington after the Christmas holidays and Margaret would go to school there for the Spring semester.  Then, after school was out for the summer, Bess, Margaret, and Bess\u2019s mother would come back to Independence and stay there through the end of the year so Margaret could go to school here.  \n\nMargaret would have gone to Jr. High back at Palmer, but she went to high school almost right across the street from where you\u2019re standing.

But Margaret Truman graduated from here in 1942.  It was a short walk from home.  \n\nThis intimacy of church, school, home, business, community \u2013 all these parts of a person\u2019s life \u2013 being within walking distance is not something we see so much anymore.  Most folks have to drive to get to their church or their school or the store now.  The people who lived in Independence at the time we\u2019re talking about would have had many of the benefits of a small town, a very narrowly focused geographic space, a true sense of \u201cbeing somewhere.\u201d  But the proximity of a large metropolitan area like Kansas City only about 10 miles west meant Independence was spared the limitations of small-town isolation.  \n\nIndependence was a good place to grow up, and the Trumans didn\u2019t want Margaret to miss that.  Despite their efforts, however, it might have been inevitable that Margaret would move on.  At age 10, she was the daughter of a US Senator.  By 21, she was the daughter of the President of the United States.  \n\nShe was not yet thirty when her folks came back from the White House.  Rather than return to Independence with them, Margaret moved on to New York City.  She represented a new generation that did not seem to feel the deep roots of her parents, or at least not in exactly the same way.  But even though Margaret might have wanted to live a faster life in New York, her parents, Harry and Bess, couldn\u2019t wait to get back to their old life in Independence.  \n\nThey moved back to what was by then finally was known as the Truman home.  A reporter asked Mr. Truman what the first thing he did after he got home was, and Harry replied, \u201cI carried the grips [the suitcases] up to the attic.\u201d  He wouldn\u2019t be needing those suitcases again any time soon.  \n\nRetirement turned out not to be exactly what the Trumans hoped it would be, though, because obviously, Harry was now a former president of the United States and his house had become a tourist attraction.

It\u2019s part of Harry S Truman National Historic Site.  \n\nBack when the Trumans first came back from the White House, though, his cousins were still living here and they were in the best spot to see how things were going to be different, because now the Trumans were famous, and everyone wanted to see where the president lived.  And the Noland cousins could see everything going on across the street.  At the time, Ethel Noland said, \u201cOf course, since Mr. Truman came back from Washington, the tourists are omnipresent.  They\u2019re there when I first look out in the morning.  They walk down Truman Road, and they survey the house from all sides.  And finally, you find them standing out in front.  And one always goes across the street and takes a picture of those at the front gate.  It seems to me that\u2019s almost an unwritten law, that they shall do this.\u201d  \n\nOne evening in 1955, Harry and Bess walked over here to the Noland\u2019s to visit his cousins.  Remember, there was no Secret Service protection for retired presidents, yet.  Bess told the story like this.  She said, \u201cWe had a funny experience the other night.  Dad [Harry \u2013 she was talking about Harry \u2013 she was telling this story to Margaret] Dad and I went over to see your cousins across the street and there were so many [sightseers] out here in front of the house we couldn\u2019t come home.  We had to spend most of the evening on the front porch all by ourselves because our cousins weren\u2019t at home.\u201d  That story shows how much the Trumans wanted to be back in their familiar old town.  \n\nFor the rest of their lives, they would have to deal with the headaches that go with being famous.  They had the money; they could have moved somewhere where they were more isolated, someplace with more land, if they had wanted to.  But they never seriously talked of moving.  In fact, they had to buy their house from Bess\u2019s mother\u2019s estate because Bess\u2019s mother died without a will only a few weeks before the Trumans left the White House for good.  So, it looks like this is where they wanted to be.  However, as they got older, their health did get to the point where they needed more help.  \n\nBy the mid-1960s, Secret Service protection was available for retired presidents, and by November 1970 that the agents were back at the Truman home.  When Truman was in office, the Secret Service had a little building in the back yard they\u2019d used, but the Trumans had torn it down before the agents returned.  \n\nSo, in 1970, the Secret Service base was in the house on the corner across Delaware Street from the Truman home.

That\u2019s where the Secret Service command post its nickname; the agents called the Truman detail \u201cTranquility Base.\u201d  If you were a Secret Service agent here at the Trumans\u2019 place in the early 1970s, you really didn\u2019t have a whole lot to do.  \n\nThe Trumans didn\u2019t have much of a domestic staff \u2013 their old part-time cook was pretty much it \u2013 so the Secret Service agents often helped out in little ways around the place.  They mow the grass sometimes.  They\u2019d replace burned out fuses, drive Bess to the grocery store, things like that.  \n\nOne time a raccoon got into the attic and Mrs. Truman wanted it captured alive, so the Secret Service agents had to catch the raccoon.  When Margaret came to visit with the grandsons, things could get a little livelier.  The little boys would set off alarms, get up on the roof of their grandparents\u2019 house and the agents would have to get them down, or they\u2019d be over here at the agents\u2019 house wanted to know how everything worked.

Despite gypsum being found on all seven continents, this place is worthy of being a National Park because gypsum sand dunes are among the rarest geologic features on earth, with only 3 in the entire world! The process of building this geologic wonder has been a long time in the making. In the mountains to the east or west, you may see lighter layers. This is gypsum! It was deposited 280 million years ago by a shallow inland sea that advanced and receded across the southwest, leaving behind the massive deposits of gypsum that make up the white sand today. Flash forward to 70 million years ago when colliding plate tectonics uplifted the horizontal gypsum layers in a massive mountain building event. Around 20 to 30 million years ago these plate tectonics began to pull apart creating the two separate mountain ranges you see today, the San Andres Mountains in the west and the Sacramento Mountains in the east. In between the mountain ranges where you now stand the earth fell away forming the Tularosa Basin. Finally, the ancient Rio Grande River flowed into the Tularosa Basin between 2 and 3 million years ago bringing with it sediments that eventually blocked any water carrying gypsum from flowing out of the basin. Later in this tour, you\u2019ll explore the modern geologic forces that have sculpted these dunes, but without the perfect series of geologic coincidences to set the stage none of this would be possible.", "audioFileUrl": "https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/2D4BFAEB-0089-DB29-530023E6744B97EC.mp3"}, {"significance": "Walk in the shoes of ice age humans and megafauna by exploring the largest collection of ice age fossilized footprints on earth", "assetId": "8B2EE60A-0E4C-4B5C-8356-111C06F12A5D", "assetName": "Stories from the Ice Age", "assetType": "places", "id": "F6153F39-C738-0956-F47E1E7D953AF4AC", "ordinal": "3", "directionsToNextStop": "Pull back onto Dunes Drive and take the left turn to the \u201cDune Life Nature Trail\u201d trailhead a few hundred feet down the road.", "audioTranscript": "What drew you to White Sands National Park today? Hiking? Sledding? Solitude? The Tularosa Basin has been a place where we as humans have been coming for thousands of years, even before the dunefield you see today formed. If you had been standing here during the last Ice Age, you would have witnessed a climate that was much cooler, wetter, and greener with a massive lake known as Lake Otero that was the size of the present-day Great Salt Lake in Utah. These were the conditions that lured the Ice Age megafauna like Columbian mammoths, giant ground sloths, dire wolves, camels, and more. This abundance of large game is likely what attracted these early human migrants to this basin. The presence of humans and megafauna at White Sands is not from the discovery of bones or artifacts, but from the preservation of fossilized footprints in the ancient lake sediments. Today, these fossilized footprints have to be cataloged and studied rapidly because as quickly as they appear at the surface, they will continue to erode away with the wind in just a matter of years. These footprints will never tell us everything we want to know about what human and megafauna life at the time was like, but they do provide snapshots. A group of humans stalked a giant ground sloth on a hunt. A woman struggled and slipped through the mud for over a mile with a set of children\u2019s feet appearing occasionally as she briefly sets her child down before moving on. A giant ground sloth made a footprint that became a puddle where children\u2019s footprints show them splashing in the water. Sets of teenagers fossilized footprints carbon-dated to around 23,000 years old, older than any definitive evidence of human habitation yet found in North America.

On Dune Life Nature Trail just up the path from the parking lot, you\u2019ll find yourself in another world where snow white dunes are dotted with dune adapted plants such as soaptree yuccas, Rio Grande cottonwoods, and hoary rosemary mint. Across the park road towards the Sacramento Mountains to the east, you will see the Chihuahuan Desert scrubland full of low-growing, thorny fauna such as creosote bush, mesquite, ocotillo, and varieties of cacti. In the dunes, you\u2019ll find full-time residents like kangaroo rats, bleached earless lizards, and over 60 species of moth found nowhere else on earth that have become color adapted to the blindingly white environment. The largest predator that lives full time in the dunes is a kit fox which weighs in at a whopping 4 pounds! Animals residing in the dunes are small, compact, and efficient with their water, never taking a drink in their life. But the White Sands community is more than just what\u2019s found in the dunes. On the edge of the dunefield where the sand meets the desert scrubland, the park receives some interesting visitors. Larger mammals like bobcats, coyotes, badgers, and even porcupines that couldn\u2019t survive in the dunes year-round make their way into the dunes to get the resources they need and then return to their homes in the scrubland. These temporary visitors to the dunes are no less of a part of the dunefield community whether their impact is big or small. Your visit to White Sands today is also a temporary one where you might come to hike, sled, or enjoy a picnic and then return home with memories to last a lifetime.

However, darting in the interdune are small, white color adapted critters doing their best to go unseen. White Sands provides one of the best examples on earth of rapid adaptation to a unique environment. These white sand dunes have only been here for around 7,000 years and in such a short time the animals that call them home have shown remarkable adaptation to their environment. Unlike the surrounding desert, at White Sands it is survival of the lightest! Over generations, certain traits like color give animals an advantage in a given environment and pass on their advantageous traits to their descendants. Here you\u2019ll find that being white color adapted not only helps an animal hide from predators, but it also keeps them cool in the scorching summers by reflecting sunlight away. The rapid change in habitat in the Tularosa Basin has led to an explosion of white, endemic species found nowhere else on earth.

The first shot of the atomic age had been fired 60 miles to the north at the Trinity Test site. For three years in near-total secrecy scientists and workers at three sites across the United States had been developing a new kind of weapon designed to bring a swift end to World War II. Known collectively as the Manhattan Project, the Trinity Test was the culmination of their years of work and within weeks of the successful test here in New Mexico the first atomic weapons would be dropped at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, avoiding a full-scale invasion of Japan, but inflicting hundreds of thousands in civilian casualties. To this day they are the only nuclear weapons to have been used. However, the opening of the nuclear age at the Trinity site has had untold impacts on the world we live in. The potential for nuclear weapons to end human existence through mutually assured destruction has dominated global politics throughout the Cold War and into the 21st century. It has brought benefits to society in the forms of nuclear energy and medicine, but the adverse impacts cannot be ignored.

A windstorm has picked up. You can feel it beating against the side of your car. It\u2019s howling all around you. As the wind increases, visibility decreases. You can see a mile away. Then 500 feet. The yucca on the next dune is no longer visible. Then 100 feet. You can no longer see the sledding family. Then 20 feet. Then 5 feet in front of you. You are in the middle of white-out blizzard conditions, but instead of snow, it\u2019s gypsum sand.

Moving only a few feet away from your vehicle could result in total disorientation.\nNow, what are some words you would use to describe our theoretical encounter? Wild? Dangerous? Perhaps even violent? As humans, we ascribe violence to nature quite often. Violent storms, volcanoes, floods are found throughout most of the world. All these forces we may fear or try to prevent, help create the stunning landscapes and natural beauty we love \u2013 and the environment you are currently looking at.\nEventually, the windstorm subsides, revealing pristine dunes, no footprints insight, with patterns of ripples coating its surface. Dunes move to new destinations, covering plants and revealing fresh ground for others to grow. Seeds fly to those new homes.\nFrom the beginning to now, without wind, this landscape would not exist. To change selenite, the crystal form of gypsum, to sand, the wind erodes the landscape. Crystals bounce off each other, collide, and break into smaller and smaller pieces, until they\u2019re the size of a grain of sand, piling high to form the dunes you are seeing.

When visitors are done with their picnics, sledding, and taking selfies the park gets dark, quiet, and nocturnal animals emerge to start their day. This is when moths appear, fluttering from yucca to yucca, making sure they will bloom again next season. Bats squeak, flap, and swoop for prey. Kit foxes\u2019 tiny paws scuttle along the dunes, chasing creatures with tinier paws. A bobcat lurks through the dunes, its eyes aglow in the moonlight. You may associate darkness with evil, uncertainty, and danger, but darkness is essential for all living things. The absence of light allows natural rhythms to take place. Artificial light disrupts this rhythm and alters the behavior of nocturnal animals. Imagine trying to sleep with the lights on or getting up for breakfast in the middle of the night. For us, darkness signals the end of the day and for nocturnal animals the beginning of theirs. In the absence of light, they can navigate, nest, hunt, and hide. Beyond helping nocturnal critters maintain their groove, the night sky has been an inspiration since the beginning of human history. On a clear night, how many stars can you see from your house? What can you do to see more? Perhaps a porch light or a bright floodlight is trespassing on your vision. The more artificial light that is near you, the fewer stars you will see.

The army center was held by the 19th Corps, which was located south of Belle Grove, or to your left front, on the high banks above Cedar Creek. That would be to your left front, marked today by the dark woods you see, not directly to your left front, but the second tree line, on the high banks above Cedar Creek. The army's left was held by the 8th Corps, sometimes called the Army of West Virginia, on the east side of the Valley Pike, which is today Route 11 that you are located on. So that is behind you and to your left about a mile and a half to two miles to your left rear. At this point of the campaign, after having won victories at both Third Winchester on September 19, and then Fisher\u2019s Hill on September 22 followed by the Burning in late September and early October General Sheridan believed the campaign was over and that Early\u2019s Army of the Valley posed no threat, Sheridan believed that all he had to decide what part of the Army to leave as a holding force in the Valley to watch General Early\u2019s army. So he left the Valley on October 15 to attend a Council of War in Washington DC. Little did he realize that his army would soon come under attack and that of course would be the Battle of Cedar Creek on October 19th. So at our next stop, stop 2, we will discuss General Early\u2019s attack and how this came about.

And the best place to watch this video on the other side of the gate from which you should have parked, so just go around the gate and you should stand right next to the interpretive panel you see here. The position that we are standing at Thoburn\u2019s redoubt was held by Col. Joseph Thoburn\u2019s division of the 8th Corps, about 1,700 men and their far left would have been just off to your east or your left, less than a half mile in that direction. The rest of the Union army would have been positioned upstream along Cedar Creek behind you and to your right so that northwest of here. You are basically facing south and southeast. On a normal day what you would clearly see looming off to the south/southeast in this direction would be the very northern end of the Massanutten Mountain range, sometimes called Three Top Mountain, including the largest peak called Signal Knob. And we will talk about that in just a minute and its importance and its role in the Battle of Cedar Creek. Cedar Creek itself, would start off behind you and to your right rear, northwest of you, flowing downstream, to your right, and eventually off to your right front, and then finally in front of you and the lowest ground in front of you. And then eventually it is going to flow into the North Fork of the Shenandoah which runs along the base of the Massanutten Mountain range. The Cedar Creek would have been held by pickets and skirmishers of the 8th Corps. Remember again, the Army of the Shenandoah, Sheridan\u2019s army numbers about 32,000 men. The 8th Corps along with the 19th Corps off to its right rear, holding the center would have been entrenched, so this is a very strong position on the bluffs above both Cedar Creek and the north fork of the Shenandoah River. 32,000 men, a very strong position. So that means that General Jubal Early, commanding the Confederate Army of the Valley has a very difficult task. He only numbers, even with reinforcements sent by General Lee in Richmond, only 14,000 at the most 15,000 men and here Lee is telling him he must attack the Union army here at Cedar Creek. That means Early is outnumbered 2 \u00bd to 1. To attack this very strong position, is almost asking the impossible. So to try to figure out some kind of plan, a way to somehow attack this nearly impregnable position, what Early will do will send his second in command, General John Gordon and some other officers to the up to the very top of Signal Knob on October 17th. Now Signal Knob being that highest peak of the Massanutten Mountain, Signal Knob got its name during the Civil War. On a clear day, if you could see that mountain peak you would see that it has a modern radio tower on it. Well during the Civil War it got its name from the fact that both sides used it as a signal station to send messages. On that very clear day of October 17th, Gordon got up there with the other officers and they could look right down on the Union army and they could see everything \u2013 they could see every road, every path, they could see every entrenchment, every cannon, every flag. They had to use that to their advantage to scout the Union army and try to come up with a plan. And they also something they had not seen before. A way to try to attack the Union army by surprise from an unexpected direction. So they came down off the mountain, and Gordon told Early his plan. Maybe there was a way to attack the left end of the Union army. Which is something no one thought the Confederates could do. How could you march part of the Confederate army opposite of the Union left? There is no way you can do that and have it be a surprise because the mountain range there, along with the North Fork of the Shenandoah and Cedar Creek, meant there was no way the Confederates could march through that very tight spot without being seen. Gordon thought there was a way and he thought he saw it from the top of Signal Knob where they could get in there using a night march without being seen and that is the plan he present to Early. But this plan is going to be very difficult. It involves dividing the Confederate army into three columns, it is going to involve a night march that means that the men all have to coordinate these three columns and arrive at their attack points on time, which is very difficult to do during the Civil War. How do these three columns communicate? Plus the largest column the one that is going to march along the base of the Massanutten Mountain and make two night crossings of the Shenandoah, have to march along the very narrow path, single file, we are talking thousands of men, not quite 8,000 men along a single file path. Very difficult to do. How are they going to stay on time and not be seen? But Early is willing to try it. So it is really one of the riskiest attack plans ever developed during the Civil War. They start this night march on the night of October 18th from Fisher\u2019s Hill.

This monument was dedicated in 1907, 43 years after the battle by the surviving members of the regiment. And it is located here along the original bed of the Valley Pike. This regiment held the far left end of the 19th Corps' battle line, and the 19th Corps would be the next corps in line that would face the Confederate attack that morning. Located just behind you and behind the trees would be the northern end of the Massanutten Mountain range including Signal Knob that we discussed at Stop #2. So after the 8th Corps is crushed and sent fleeing, the 19th Corps now faces the Confederate attack. Fugitives from the 8th Corps would come streaming over the ridge that you see behind you and through the 19th Corps battle line and the fire brought on by the Confederate attack is going to alert the 19th Corps that the attack is underway along with those fugitives. One member of the 19th Corps would later recall the beginning of the Confederate attack that morning when he later wrote this, \u201cI was awakened at the first signs of day by the terrific clap of the thunder and sprang into a sitting position and listened. The thunder was the tremendous volley of the enemy that was pouring into the 8th Corps devoted camp. I listened for the yell of our men but alas it never came, instead the Ay-yi-yi of the Confederate yell and horror of horrors it seemed to me as if our whole left was enveloped and enfolded by this cry.\" So the 19th Corps realizes they face two distinct threats. The main Confederate attack is coming from the left, or behind you, unexpectedly, but they also are going to face another Confederate attack from their front. The rest of the 19th Corps battle line is located on a ridge, a high bluff above Cedar Creek, for about a mile their line stretches on these bluffs behind me. Cedar Creek is below you less than a half a mile, to your south, or to your left. So that threat is coming from their front still the south, but now a new threat is coming from their east, or behind you. So to counter this new threat, troops from the 19th Corps will be shifted over here, and form a new line along the Valley Pike, to face east. It\u2019s called refusing your line. So they face two directions. The main line still faces south, or in this direction. The new line is going to stretch up the road to face east. To face that new threat \u2013 refusing your line. To buy time, to conduct this new maneuver, another part of the 19th Corps, a brigade of just over 1,000 men, will be sent across the Valley Pike in order to basically sacrifice themselves and slow the Confederate onslaught up. Will talk about that action at our next stop, stop 4. After the 8th Corps fugitives come streaming through this new line, they are followed by the Confederate attack, they come springing out of the dense fog, and strikes the 19th Corps line here along the Valley Pike. Despite this new line being formed it wasn\u2019t enough and it is going to start driving the 19th Corps back up their entrenchment line and eventually back towards Belle Grove. They conduct a fighting withdrawal and eventually, as we will discuss at a future stop, back towards Belle Gove itself. From here we will move to our next stop, stop 4.

It is a 1790\u2019s Plantation Manor House and it is managed by another partner, Belle Grove, Incorporated. Belle Grove is well worth a visit if you have time, it is a beautifully restored Plantation Manor House. It was built by Isaac Hite, Jr. who married Nelly Madison, who would be the sister of future President James Madison. They\u2019ve restored it and furnished it with period pieces and actually some original belongings of the Hite family. So if you have time, start your visit behind you at the Welcome Center. They have guided house tours, and the grounds tours are free. So please spend your time, if you have time to do so, and visit the manor house and the grounds itself.\n\nAs I said, before and during the Battle of Cedar Creek, this was General Sheridan\u2019s Headquarters, although General Sheridan as we have talked about was not here during the battle. Having gone to Washington D.C. returning to the Valley on the 18th of October, but having spent the night in Winchester 15 miles to the north which is behind you. Behind me or to your south, you will actually see the Massanutten Mountain range. Signal Knob itself is actually hidden behind the trees directly behind me. As we discussed at stop #3, the 19th Army Corps, holding the center of the Union line had come under attack and had been driven out of its entrenchments, and now is fighting across the ground in front of Belle Grove or south of us. Belle Grove being the army\u2019s headquarters had been surrounded by supplies, tents, and wagons, again this is the nerve center of the Union army. And although the 19th Corps was fighting hard to try to hold back the Confederate onslaught, it was simply a matter of time before the Confederates reached this area. While the 19th Corps is retreating in this direction they are scrambling as you can imagine, to evacuate Belle Grove. What again is assisting the Confederate attack has they drive the 19th Corps in this direction is that dense fog, we keep mentioning because it hides the Confederate troops from view until they are right on top of the Union line. One Union soldier in the 19th Corps remembered this during the fighting as they fought back in this direction towards Belle Grove. He later recalled, \u201cThe fog was so dense that we could not see the enemy in front of us. But the rapid and incessant discharge of small arms and canon, the bursting of shells and whizzing of bullets, mingling into the sound like that of a moaning wind told us unmistakably of its presence.\u201d Well eventually it was just a matter of time before Belle Grove fell and it did at 7:00 am, about two hours after the Confederate assault began, the 19th Corps is driven out of this area. Belle Grove falls, although most of the supplies, wagons, and tents have been evacuated, and the Confederates pass through this area. That leaves only the 6th Corps remaining. The 6th Corps occupying the ground behind you in your right rear, which is to our northwest. They are going to form along Meadow Brook. As you drive to your next stop, stop #6 the Cemetery Hill, you are going to drive along Meadow Brook Road. The Confederates are going to be coming from your right to left and the Union line the 6th Corps is going to be on the high ground on either side of that road.

Carmel Cemetery which at the time of the battle was known as Middletown Cemetery. Cemetery behind me obviously was much smaller at the time of the battle, but it is still an active cemetery today, and that is why it is obviously why it is much larger. The town of Middletown itself is actually right behind these trees, to your left, or to your east, less than a half a mile away. More obvious is the Signal Knob and Massanutten Mountain which you clearly see in the distance behind me or to your south, southeast. The battlefield here is changed somewhat since 1864, and that is the growth of the non-historic vegetation or woods that you see both off to your left or to your east. Those don\u2019t belong. And also to our south, directly to our south at the end of the cemetery, those don\u2019t belong either, and they have grown up since the time of the battle. Along with the trees to our right or to the west, they would have been woods but much farther back or farther to the west. That\u2019s why the Park Service, when we put up our wayside exhibits that belong at each stop, like this one here, that\u2019s why we commissioned this original piece of artwork to try to depict what the actual view shed would have looked like in 1864. So if you take a careful look at this wayside, this painting depicts the historic view shed and what the soldiers would have seen in 1864. So as we have previously talked about at stops 3 & 4, the Confederate attack had rolled up the Union line crushing the 8th Corps and then the 19th Corps and driving them out of their camps and north and capturing Belle Grove the Union army\u2019s headquarters. That left only the 6th Corps, as the only remaining corps on the battlefield to offer any resistance to the Confederate attack. And although they fought along Meadow Brook, the stream, we discussed and then drove along to get to this stop. The 6th Corps alone could not stop the Confederate attack and eventually as the 6th Corps retreated it left this as the only defensible position on which to make a stand. And one division of the 6th Corps, about 2,400 men of a division led by George Washington Getty, realized this was the place, the only place they could take a stand. And with this historic view shed, kind of recreated in this painting, and you can see a sliver of it kind of here through the opening in the trees. This really became the place to try to stop the Confederate attack. So George Washington Getty\u2019s division, formed a battle line here, on the morning of the battle around 8:00 to try to stop or at least slow the Confederate attack down. So Getty formed his men along the south face of the hill, directly in front of you, and then also turned it to the left along the east base of the hill, or over here to your left. So they faced two directions. And for about an hour and a half, they literally stopped the Confederate attack. They had some support on their right too along the south face of the hill along the same route we just drove up a minute ago. They stopped three separate Confederate attacks against the hill. The first two were kind of, ill-conceived or the first two Confederate attacks were disorganized because by this point, as you can imagine, the Confederates were disorganized having marched all night, and then fought four hours to get here, and thought they could roll over the Union line, and this is really the first time they met any resistance. Frustrated, General Early, the Confederate commander, lined up his 30 pieces of artillery along the Valley Pike which you can barely see out there in the distance. About a mile away that is the dark trees it\u2019s where modern factories are today. And he bombarded this spot for half hour to try to soften up the Union defenders. During this bombardment, one of Getty\u2019s brigade commanders, General Bidwell, you can see here in the painting, he actually got mortally wounded and hit by an artillery shell, mortally wounded and would die from his wounds. And after a half an hour they launched a third attack against the Union line. This third attack actually reached the slopes of the hill and got amongst the Union batteries of artillery involving hand to hand fighting. Literally hand spikes and rammers. Didn\u2019t take the battery but was very intense fighting. But it was that third attack that finally drove the Union line off the hill because it outflanked Getty\u2019s division on the right or over here to your west. If he had stayed Getty realized he would be surrounded and captured. So he finally around 9:30 having stood here for an hour and a half, ordered his men to retreat. And that was really was the last Union resistance that morning to the Confederate assault. At that point the entire Union army was retreating north of Middletown, behind you, to your north where they tried to rally their lines. The Confederates followed, forming their final battle line to the north which we will talk about at our next stop.

And this marks the final Confederate line, or at least part of the final Confederate line on the morning of the battle. Around 10:30 after the Confederates pushed out to this area. Around that same time as the Confederate advance finally halted, and the Confederates were beginning to reorganize their lines, discovering as we discussed at stop #6, that up to a third of the men were back looting the Union camps, another controversy occurred in the Confederate army. And that would go down as the Fatal Halt. General Gordon, second in command of the Confederate army, was arguing with Jubal Early, the top commander, that they should be pushing forward, moving north to your right because that is where the Union army is rallying, about a mile to our north. And they should push the Union army off the battlefield. Gordon is arguing that the battle is not over, the Union army is not defeated, and that they should push on. Early, however, is saying we have done enough for one day, the Confederates are too disorganized, remember all those Confederates are looting and as far as he was concerned the Union army was done. At this point, the Confederacy captured over 1,000 Union prisoners and 24 cannon. Early figured the best the Union army could do, since they were so badly defeated was retreat to Winchester their main base of operations about 15 miles to the north. As far as Early was concerned this battle was over. So he would gather in his captured spoils, wait till nightfall. He had won the great victory that Lee had hoped for in the Valley and would retreat under the cover of darkness. This controversy would go down again as the Fatal Halt.

It was in this area where General Sheridan would arrive back from Winchester and would greet his retreating and rallying army. As we have talked about previously, Sheridan was not here when the battle began. He had spent the previous night in Winchester, having no idea that his army would come under attack on the morning of the 19th of October. He gets up that morning having no idea that his army has been attacked and defeated. Starts riding back to his army, hearing the distance thunder of artillery, thinking maybe it is a skirmish, or a reconnaissance by his forces. Only to be told that his army is under attack, is retreating, as he rides south along the Valley Pike. The Valley Pike would be off to your east, or to your left. You are looking south downstream along Meadow Brook. He soon is greeted by retreating Union soldiers from the battlefield, having come over 10 miles, spreading rumors of defeat and disaster. They start to cheer Sheridan, realizing he is coming back to the battlefield. In typical Sheridan fashion, he tells them stop cheering me, if you love your country follow me back to the battlefield. And many do, they turn and follow him. This begins what would become as Sheridan start to pick up his pace and ride back to the battlefield - Sheridan\u2019s Ride. He will ride over 10 miles up the Valley Pike, which is now Route 11 today, US Route 11. Rallying more and more soldiers along the way, and finally where Kline\u2019s Mill Road greets or intersects with Route 11 today, the Valley Pike back then, he will greet his rallying Union army north of Middletown. He later left a vivid account of the first sight that greeted him upon seeing his shattered army, north of Middletown that morning. He wrote, \u201cThere burst upon our view an appalling spectacle of panic. I stared down upon our stricken army, hundreds of slightly wounded men, throngs of others not hurt but utterly demoralized and baggage wagons by the score all pressing to the rear in hopeless confusion. Telling only too plainly that a disaster had occurred at the front.\u201d His officers greeted him. They were now rallying his army south of Kline\u2019s Mill road in the fields you have been passing by. One of his officers told him I think we are in good enough shape to retreat back to Winchester, his main base of operations. Of course Sheridan did not want to hear anything of retreating. Once his forces were in good enough shape he was going to immediately counterattack. This battle could not go down as a Union defeat here in the Shenandoah Valley he realized so close to the upcoming Presidential election in early November. One of his staff officers suggested, \u201cShow yourself to your men General, let them know you are back on the battlefield.\u201d And that is exactly what Sheridan would do. He would start riding along his rallying lines and the effect was instantaneous, his demoralized men instantly rallied to his presence. One of his men later talked about this, writing, \u201cThe men sprang to their feet and cheered only as men under such circumstances can. Hope and confidence returned and abound. No longer did we merely hope that the worst was over. That we could hold our ground till night, or worse to make an orderly retreat to Winchester. Now all burned to avenge and attack the enemy, to drive him back, retrieve our honor, and sleep in our old campground that night. And every man knew that Sheridan would do it.\u201d The attack wouldn\u2019t start immediately however, it would take several hours to straighten his lines and make final adjustments, but eventually the Union counterattack would begin that afternoon at 4:00 and that attack we will discuss at the final stop on our tour, stop 9.", "audioFileUrl": "https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/0AFC3ADC-D34E-5628-17852A0B742DA2D5.mp3"}, {"significance": "At four o'clock in the afternoon, the Federal counterattack struck the Confederates here.

The visitor center is 0.4 south on Valley Pike (U.S. Route 11).", "audioTranscript": "We are now at stop #9, the final stop on the tour. Along the Valley Pike, which is today Route 11. You should be at the interpretive marker labeled-The Union Counterattack. Face the marker and you will be looking to your west, and in the distance you will see the Alleghany Mountains. Also, looking in that direction, to your left front, amongst the trees, you will see the metal roof of the historic Miller House, which we talked about and saw at stop #7. Remember that Miller House is along the final Confederate line that afternoon, just north of Middletown and along the historic Miller Lane, today called Cougill Road. That marks the left end of the Confederate line, which was lined with heavy stone walls and made an excellent defensive position. Also, remember the Confederate line ran at least a half a mile, if not slightly longer beyond the Miller House. The right end of the Confederate line actually continued to stretch on the other side of the Valley Pike, Route 11 today, behind you, but also farther to your south, closer to Middletown which is off to your left. Also, looking to your left rear, you will see in the distance the top of Massanutten Mountain including Signal Knob. The Confederate right again stretched to the north of Middletown, on the other side of the Valley Pike and beyond where modern day interstate 81 is today. Despite the fact that many Confederates were still looting the Union camps, remember General Early the Confederate commander believes that he can wait out the Union army which is to your right a mile to your north, until nightfall and then retreat under cover of darkness. As we know, General Sheridan has returned to the battlefield, he has rallied his army, and now will begin his counterattack around 4:00 pm that afternoon. That counterattack starts and that Union lines stretching 2 miles in length. His line also stretching beyond interstate 81 where it is today and across the Valley Pike will sweep across the open ground in front of you, from your right to left, and came rolling across this ground which was much more open back then, and towards the final Confederate line. Despite being outnumbered the Confederates stood their ground and gave the Union attack a murderous fire. One Union soldier in the attack later recounted this. He said, \u201cWe got into the open fields, the rebels pouring into our faces a deadly fire from behind a stone wall. We gain a hill in the enemy front and here we halt and pour in our own fire. Of all the fires I was ever under during the war I think it was by far the hottest. The air boils and seized with mini\u00e9 balls and screeching shells and solid shot and deadly canister. All tear and plunge through our ranks. Our boys fall thick and fast.\u201d At first the Union counterattack was basically halted in its tracks. And some of the heaviest and deadliest fighting of the entire battle took place in the fields right out in front of you. What finally brought the Confederate line, broke it I should say, and drove it back was the fact that the Union right was much longer than the Confederate left and it began to overlap it at the far end of Miller Lane and began to outflank it and drive it in. And what turned the Confederate retreat, because the Confederate left began to crumble into a rout, was Union cavalry. There was an immense Union cavalry force way beyond the Confederate right and beyond the Confederate left as it was, and began to sweep in across the open fields. Some of that Union cavalry led by none other than George Armstrong Custer, who led a division of Union cavalry, came sweeping in beyond the Confederate left and turned that retreat into a panic. The Confederate left basically crumbled and the whole Confederate line, from its left to right or west to east towards you crumbled. Despite the efforts of Confederate officers, the Confederate line just began to roll up and collapse and the whole Confederate battle line just retreated, routed back towards Middletown. And the same ground they fought so hard to gain that morning was basically now lost. Through Middletown, passed Belle Grove, over Cedar Creek, through the streets of Strasburg, there was a traffic jam. Much of the spoils of war they captured that morning were now lost including all 24 guns they had captured, they lost all of those and 24 of their own. So the Union counterattack captured 48 guns during the retreat. Also, they captured, the Union army captured 1,200, one thousand two hundred prisoners. What was left of Early\u2019s army tried to rally itself at Fisher\u2019s Hill where they started the night before. The Battle of Cedar Creek would end as a tremendous Union victory. Total casualties that day for the Union army 5,700 killed, wounded, missing, including almost 600 dead. The Confederate army although not nearly as high in number were about 2,900, almost 3,000 but considering how much smaller the Confederate army was a very high percentage. This basically finished off Early\u2019s army.
