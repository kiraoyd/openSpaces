Slightly more modern perhaps than others. What distinguished these launch centers, was that they were surrounded by fences, and they were highly secured areas. So, you couldn\u2019t just drive up and go in like you might be able to do with someone\u2019s house in the American West, where you can sort of show up and they\u2019ll invite you in for dinner. But, beneath this house, is actually what was really interesting.\" ~ Historian Gretchen Heefner</p> </blockquote> <p><span>Delta-01 occupies an open, grassy tract of land on the west side of a county road,\u00a0approximately one-half mile north of Interstate 90\u2019s Exit 127. The complex\u00a0occupies approximately 6.4 acres\u00a0of the South Dakota landscape with approximately 1.85 acres located within the security fence.\u00a0Approaching the site from the interstate highway, it looks like a lone ranch house in the open grassland. Over the\u00a0years, most travelers on the nearby Interstate probably did not give the site a second look or even know\u00a0what military capabilities lay within the South Dakota plains.</span></p> <h3><span>Launch Control Facility (Topside)</span></h3> <p>This building functioned as topside support for the underground Launch Control Center which lay 31 feet below the Launch Control Facility (LCF). It acted as a multi-purpose facility.\u00a0<br /> <br /> The topside supported the missileers stationed underground in carrying out their mission. Equipment such as a backup generator for auxiliary power, and environmental control provided backup support in the event of a power outage or an attack. There were always eight people on the topside, all enlisted Air Force personnel who were stationed at Ellsworth Air Force Base, 60 miles to the west. These personnel included a Facility Manager (top ranking Non-Commissioned Officer on-site), a cook and six security police. They worked three straight days on, followed by three days off.<br /> <br /> In addition, the site had bunk housing for visitors, such as maintenance teams who were required to remain over night at the nearest LCF if they exceeded 16 hours in a work shift at one of the missile silos. They would spend the night at the nearest LCF before driving back to Ellsworth Air Force Base the following day. The building also contained a Security Control Center, where all security activities were coordinated and personnel would be processed when coming on site. Other areas on the topside included a day room, dining area and recreational room that Air Force support personnel used while at the facility.</p> <h3><span>Launch Control Center Delta-01</span></h3> <p>For every 10 Minuteman nuclear missiles (known as a Flight) there would be an underground Launch Control Center (LCC) that remotely commanded and controlled the missiles. Since there were 1000 Minuteman Missiles across the upper Great Plains from the early-1960s up until the mid-1990s, there would have been 100 Launch Control Centers. The LCC at Delta-01 was 31 feet beneath the ground of the Launch Control Facility.</p> <p>Two missileers worked and lived on 24 hour alert duty shifts within the LCC. There was an eight ton blast door that had to be opened from within before an oncoming Missile Combat Crew could enter the LCC. The two person crew would spend most of their time monitoring the status of their 10 missiles. Among their other work duties was authenticating message traffic, remotely monitoring maintenance at the silos and assisting with the dispatch of security police if any motion sensing alarms were tripped at the silos. When the missileers were not performing work duties they would pass time by reading, watching television or studying for master's degrees through a special Air Force educational program. There was also a bunk provided for one missileer to sleep while the other crewmember kept an eye on the weapons system. Former missileer,\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/davidblackhurst.htm\">David Blackhurst</a>\u00a0remembered that\u00a0missile\u00a0duty was \"hours and hours of sheer boredom, punctuated by seconds of panic.\"</p> <p>Missileers waited and waited over several decades for a launch command they hoped would never arrive.

The entire site is 6.4 acres with approximately 1.9 acres located inside the security fence. Delta-01 is located in a rural setting and the site's access road, Jackson County Road, is an improved gravel road. The landscape surrounding Delta-01 is open agricultural land of native grasses. A couple of small agricultural outbuildings are located to the east of the site. From the site, a distant view of Interstate 90 and a billboard is visible to the south. Delta-01 includes fourteen contributing resources - the Delta-01 site, Launch Control Facility support building, Launch Control Center, heated vehicle storage building, hard HF transmit antenna, hard high-frequency (HF) receive antenna, hardened ultra-high frequency (UHF) antenna, survivable low frequency communication system antenna, cathodic protection rectifier, sewage lagoon, helicopter pad, ICBM super-high frequency satellite terminal antenna, television satellite dish, and HICS. Delta-01 does not include any noncontributing resources. Terrain at the site rises gradually toward the north. A chain-link security fence, topped with strands of barbed wire, encloses the site's buildings and structures. Access to the site is provided by a gently curving gravel driveway on the west side of the county road. The driveway passes over a steel cattle guard and through a remote-controlled, chain-link, sliding gate in the security fence. The Launch Control Facility support building and the vehicle storage building are located just inside the security fence, and an asphalt drive and parking area are located in front of them. The Launch Control Center, accessed from the Launch Control Facility support building, is located below ground and is not visible. The remaining area inside the security fence is covered with native grass that was routinely mowed by the Air Force. The area inside the security fence includes a variety of electronic, mechanical, and recreational features to support the facility, including a volleyball court, horseshoe pit, underground diesel storage tank, aboveground diesel storage tank, water well, gas pump, basketball hoop, flagpole, and utility poles. A code burner is located in the grassy area near the volleyball court. This open metal drum mounted on metal legs was used to burn security codes. These associated features and landscape elements provide insight into the use of the facilities by the Air Force and are significant elements of the site. The HF transmit antenna, hard HF receive antenna, hardened UHF antenna, survivable low-frequency communication system antenna, ICBM super-high-frequency satellite terminal antenna, and television satellite dish are located within the security fence. The cathodic protection rectifier is located outside the security fence along the access road. The underground HICS is not visible at the site. A concrete helicopter pad and two sewage lagoons are located outside of the security fence to the south. The area outside of the security fence features native grasses. A barbed-wire fence with wooden posts surrounds the facility's two sewage lagoons in the southeast comer of the site. The Minuteman ICBM Launch Control Facility Delta-01 contains a wealth of historic objects, furnishings, and technical equipment that reflect the successive use of the facilities by the Air Force. Delta-01, complete with its contents, was transferred from the Air Force to the National Park Service. The historic objects, furnishings, and equipment provide valuable insight into the use of this facility by the Air Force.

On the surface, no weapon is visible. But beneath the empty prairies and forested hills the gyroscopes are eternally spinning; these are the master navigators of jam-proof guidance systems, each ready to steer holocaustal destruction to a pre-selected target.\u201d<br /> ~ John Hubbell, \u201cThe Missile That Closed The Gap,\u201d Readers Digest, October 1962.</p> </blockquote> <p>There is no better place to witness the Minuteman\u2019s role in the Cold War than at Launch Facility Delta-09. From 1963 until 1991 Delta-09 contained a fully operational Minuteman Missile. The Delta-09 silo was one of 150 spread across western South Dakota. In total there were 1,000 Minuteman missiles\u00a0deployed from the 1960's into the early 1990's. These nuclear sentinels waited silent and deadly to perform their destructive duty at a moment\u2019s notice.</p> <h3><span><strong><span class=\"subheading\">The Minuteman \u2013 Technological Wonder</span></strong></span></h3> <p>The first Minuteman housed in Delta-09\u2019s silo was the IB. The IB was part of the second evolution\u00a0of the system. An improved encasement for the missile\u2019s motor led to an effective increase in range from the 4,300 miles of its predecessor, the IA, to over 6,000 miles for the IB. The IB weighed over 65,000 pounds yet could travel at speeds in excess of 15,000 miles an hour. To put this speed into perspective, consider that a person driving across the continental United States will average 50 hours for the trip. If they instead piggybacked on a Minuteman their travel time would be cut to five minutes. A Minuteman could strike its intended target within the Soviet Union in less than 30 minutes.</p> <p>In the early 1970's Minuteman II\u2019s replaced the Minuteman IB in the 44th Missile Wing across western South Dakota. The missile housed in the Delta-09 Launch Facility today is a replica of the Minuteman II missile. The Minuteman II was considered a technological wonder at the time of its deployment. Upgrades had been made in order to improve precision and range of America\u2019s existing ICBM force. The Minuteman II had a range of up to 7,500 miles, effectively placing it within reach of almost anywhere on earth. It had the capability to strike within 900 yards of its intended target.</p> <h3><span><strong><span class=\"subheading\">The Minuteman \u2013 Technological Terror</span></strong></span></h3> <p>Each Minuteman II carried a 1.2 megaton warhead. This singular weapon could wreak untold devastation upon an enemy, making it truly a technological terror. A 1.2 megaton warhead is equivalent to one million, two hundred thousand tons of dynamite. The Minuteman II\u2019s warhead was sixty-six times more powerful than the atomic bomb that devastated Hiroshima, Japan and killed 140,000 people just before the end of World War II. One the most shocking statistics is that the Minuteman II\u2019s warhead was more powerful than all the bombs the Army Air Force dropped on Europe in their successful bombing campaign that led to American victory in World War II.</p> <p>A Minuteman II warhead's 1.2 megaton explosion would release an unprecedented amount of energy. Any structures at or near ground zero are immediately vaporized. The blast fireball is a mile in width.

Two years later Delta-09 was turned over to the Strategic Air Command (SAC) on 1 November 1963, making it one of the first Minuteman sites to be activated at Ellsworth. The Launch Facility housed a Minuteman IB missile from 1963 until the early 1970's. Between 1971 and 1973, facilities at Delta-09 were modified slightly when Ellsworth replaced its arsenal of Minuteman I missiles with the more advanced Minuteman II.<br /> <br /> The most important changes associated with this conversion were contained within the missiles themselves, since Minuteman II featured a more powerful propulsion system and a more accurate guidance system than its predecessor. Changes included installation of new electronic ground-support equipment in existing racks at the Launch Facility; and the installation of electronic filters, seals, and circuit-breaking equipment at both sites to protect the facilities against damage from the electromagnetic pulses released by atomic blasts.</p> <h4>Security System Upgrade</h4> <p>The improved minuteman physical security system (IMPSS) antenna was installed at the launch site in 1989. IMPSS is a microprocessor-based surveillance system designed to detect outer zone intruders. It replaced troublesome older security systems so sensitive that they could be set off by \"elk, rabbits, even high-jumping grasshoppers.\" A hardened UHF antenna, installed in 1968 to link the Launch Facility with the Strategic Air Command's airborne launch control center, is located a few feet to the northwest of the silo opening. It rests atop a thirteen-foot-diameter, reinforced-concrete base, shaped like an inverted saucer. The antenna itself is housed inside a cast-steel frustum capped with a conical, gray fiberglass weather dome.</p> <h4>Always Ready, Always Waiting - Ready For Launch</h4> <p>24 hours a day, seven days a week for 365 days a year Delta-01 was operational. No matter if there were white-out blizzards or 110 degree heat, operations at Delta-01 went on around the clock. Literally thousands of personnel lived and worked at the site for nearly three decades. This record of constant vigilance is astounding.</p> <h4>Delta-09 & Minuteman Missile National Historic Site - Preserving the Cold War</h4> <p>In September 1991, all 450 of the nation's Minuteman II missiles were taken off alert. Delta-09\u00a0was deactivated in early 1993 and placed on \"caretaker status.\" Deactivation included the removal of classified electronic equipment, hazardous materials, environmentally sensitive materials, and equipment saved for use at other sites from Delta-09.\u00a0<br /> <br /> In 1993 the United States Air Force and the National Park Service initiated studies to determine whether Launch Control Facility Delta-01 and Delta-09 could be preserved as a unit of the National Park Service. On November 9, 1999 Congress designated Delta-01 and Delta-09 as Minuteman Missile National Historic Site and the bill was signed into law by President Bill Clinton.<br /> <br /> Slight modifications have been made to Delta-09 to prepare it for interpretation as a static display. The launcher closure has been permanently fixed in a partially open position, in agreement with the START Treaty, and a glass and aluminum viewing enclosure was installed over the opening in 2001. A deactivated training missile was installed in the launch tube in 2001. The glass viewing enclosure allows visitors to see into the launcher to view the training missile.</p>", "audioDescription": "The Delta-09 site is located approximately 10 miles west-northwest of Launch Control Facility Delta-01. The Launch Facility occupies part of an open, grassy tract of land straddling a Pennington County Road, about 0.6 miles west and south of Interstate 90 Exit 116. The 90 acre site includes 10 acres that were in exclusive use by the Air Force including 1 acre within the security fence and 80 acres that were in concurrent use by the Air Force. The Delta-09 site includes nine contributing resources\u2014the overall site, the missile launcher, the Launch Facility support building, the improved Minuteman physical security antenna, the hard UHF antenna, the cathodic protection rectifier, two azimuth markers, and a HICS cable marker. Delta-09 is surrounded on the north, west, and south sides by Buffalo Gap National Grassland property under ownership of the United States Forest Service. The launch structures are concentrated inside a rectangular area surrounded by a chain-link security fence. A double gate is located on the east side of the security fence. A gravel access drive leads from the double gate to the nearby county road. The area inside the enclosure has been graded to form a level, earthen platform that is elevated a few feet above the surrounding terrain. The platform has a gravel surface, and was specifically planned to provide maneuver space for the truck-like transporter-erector vehicles that hauled and emplaced the Minuteman missiles. The area surrounding the platform is native grass and the area was routinely mowed by the Air Force. The missile launcher and soft support building are located near the southern end of the maneuver space platform, with most of their structural elements underground. A smaller rectangular area at the north end of the platform outlined by four, low, small concrete corner pylons served as a landing pad for helicopters. Floodlights mounted atop two wooden utility poles at opposite comers of the maneuver space provided illumination for nighttime maintenance activities at the site. Two remnants of the concrete-base pad from the earlier outer zone security system antennas remain at the site: a square concrete pad with four reflector mount pedestals is located to the southwest (rear) of the missile launcher and a clutter monument and footing of the antenna pedestal are located to the rear (south) of the Launch Facility support building.", "isPassportStampLocation": "0", "passportStampLocationDescription": "", "passportStampImages": [], "managedByUrl": "https://www.nps.gov/mimi/planyourvisit/visiting-launch-facility-missile-silo-delta-09.htm", "isOpenToPublic": "1", "isMapPinHidden": "0", "npmapId": "", "geometryPoiId": "", "isManagedByNps": "1", "amenities": ["Historical/Interpretive Information/Exhibits", "Information Kiosk/Bulletin Board", "Parking - Auto", "Parking - Bus/RV", "Restroom - Accessible", "Toilet - Vault/Composting", "Wheelchair Accessible"], "managedByOrg": "", "quickFacts": [{"id": "5C252B96-2DEB-4EF4-91D1-B5D2B202FCD7", "value": "Six miles east of Wall, South Dakota, south of I-90, exit 116.", "name": "Location"}, {"id": "208F1B3C-44DC-4CF5-9A61-9B26A364D701", "value": "Minuteman I & II launch facility used from 1963-1993", "name": "Significance"}, {"id": "E32D2136-A184-4C1A-91D2-4C20CEF9CBAF", "value": "Part of Minuteman Missile National Historic Site", "name": "Designation"}], "location": "", "locationDescription": "", "credit": "", "multimedia": []}

Eliot and George B. Dorr recognized the natural beauty of Mount Desert Island and the need for its preservation. Dorr purchased the Sieur de Monts Spring area in 1909 and named it the Wild Gardens of Acadia.<br /> <br /> On July 8, 1916, Sieur de Monts National Monument was established, and at this time encompassed 6,634 acres, including four lakes and ten mountains, within a contiguous boundary. George Dorr was appointed the park\u2019s first superintendent, and that same year formally established the Wild Gardens of Acadia Corporation to acquire land for public use and for educational study and scientific research. He placed his private holdings in the corporation which included the Sieur de Monts Spring parcel and much of the Great Meadow, with the<br /> intention of donating them to the monument at a future date. Notably, the monument\u2019s boundary did not include the Tarn, which had been transferred to the Trustees in May of the previous year.<br /> <br /> In 1918, the Wild Gardens of Acadia was recognized by the American Society of Landscape Architects. The following year, on February 16, 1919, Sieur de Monts National Monument became Lafayette National Park. Over the years,\u00a0Dorr had apparently begun surveys for a \u201cgarden approach\u201d to the entire Sieur de Monts Spring area. This approach corresponds to a 1926 donation of a north-south linear tract of land (Tract 11-114) that was conveyed from the Wild Gardens of Acadia Corporation, Sieur de Monts Spring Company, and George Dorr to the U.S. Government on May 1, 1926.<br /> <br /> On August 11, 1930, Tracts 11-113 (120.3 acres) and 11-120 (25.7 acres) encompassing the Great Meadow and the Sieur de Monts Spring area were transferred from George Dorr and the Wild Gardens of Acadia Corporation to John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Land and easements associated with the Museum property, Tract 11-121 (2.3 acres), were transferred from the Sieur de Monts Spring Company to Lafayette National Park Museum of Stone Age Antiquities on July 22, 1930. On August 12, 1930, this same land and easements, and the right for<br /> expansion, was conveyed to the U.S. Government. Nearby, Tract 12-107 (32 acres) that encompassed the Tarn was transferred from the HCTPR to the U.S. Government on July 22, 1931 (Land Ownership Record, 1944).<br /> <br /> Over time, various attempts by Dorr and others led to multiple plans for paths and gardens in this area. In 1961, Superintendent Harold A. Hubler offered space to the Bar Harbor Garden Club to develop an exhibition garden dedicated to the display and propagation of the island\u2019s native wild flowers. The gardens and their winding gravel paths were laid out just north of the spring building [Nature Center] amongst \u201ca tangle of maples and blackberries\u201d damaged in the 1947 fire. The project gestured to the many wild gardens plans envisioned by George Dorr. As part of the arrangement, the park agreed to maintain the irrigation system and provide supplies. In 1985, the Wild Gardens of Acadia was acknowledged as a \u201cSignificant Contribution to Horticulture\u201d by the Garden Club of America.<br /> <br /> In 2010, the Wild Gardens of Acadia became an official committee of Friends of Acadia and formalized this new standing through a partnership with Friends of Acadia and Acadia National Park\u2014ensuring\u00a0continued success and support from the park as an educational resource. The Wild Gardens of Acadia committee received the park's Partnership Award in 2011 in recognition of the \u201cWild Gardens of Acadia Volunteers for 50 years of devoted stewardship\u201d from the National Park Service.</p>", "audioDescription": "A series of divided gardens with paths running through them.

Several trails in the area offer visitors a chance to go for a short or long hike. All visitors should be wildlife-aware and know how to behave in case of an encounter with a bear, moose or wolf. <h3>Geology</h3> <br /> Savage River is one of several braided rivers in Denali that are characterized by transitory channels meandering across wide beds of sediment over time. However this behavior is not the result of glacial melt, as is the case for most braided rivers in the park, because no glaciers remain in the Savage River watershed. Savage River is braided because of high sediment input from brittle rock, and from a relative lack of vegetation stabilizing its headwaters.<br /> <br /> An important transition zone that illustrates the glacial history of this area is located about halfway between the Savage River vehicular bridge and the Savage River Loop Trail footbridge to the north. Upstream (south) from this point, Savage River runs wide and shallow in a U-shaped valley typical of glacial scouring. Downstream (north), Savage River runs fast and restricted through a V-shaped valley typical of river erosion. Look for these distinctive shapes as you cross the vehicular bridge. While more extensive glaciations have affected the topography of the canyon in the past, they occurred over two million years ago. The river has therefore had substantial time to erode the V-shaped canyon that we see today.<br /> <br /> The Savage River canyon is one of the few places where erosion has exposed the Yukon-Tanana Terrane bedrock along the road. Take a closer look and you\u2019ll notice large amounts of mica-quartz schist, a shiny rock that gets its sparkle from the flaky mineral sericite and quartz veins. The varieties of metamorphic rock in the Yukon-Tanana Terrane, along with the degree to which they have been folded and faulted, attest to the terrane\u2019s age and dynamic history.<br /> <br /> Savage Rock, the jagged outcrop that you can walk to just uphill from the Savage River parking lot, is a surprising stumper. Why this outcrop is so prominent compared to its surroundings\u2014despite being made of similar rocks\u2014remains a mystery.

It is 221 feet tall. At the base, it is 30 feet square. At the top it is 15 feet square with a pyramid topper pointing 13 feet high. An enclosed spiral staircase built inside the monument provides access to a viewing deck at the top. Seven small rectangular windows are only on the north side of the monument in the stairwell, visible at each pass of the spiral staircase. Square windows are on all four sides of the monument at the viewing deck level. In the center of the monument is a circular newel that runs from the base up to the viewing deck. At the base of the newel, behind an iron gate, is a marble Tuscan column about 8 feet high as a memorial to Joseph Warren. The monument stands at the peak of a hill. The park is largely green space with symmetrical pathways leading from the streets up to the monument. The monument is surrounded by an iron picket fence. Immediately to the north of the monument is the Bunker Hill Lodge, a relatively small, one story granite structure with its primary outdoor feature being six fluted granite columns supporting a pediment that forms the entry point. Inside is a domed entry vestibule with yellow and cream Italian marble and a white marble mosaic floor. To the left is an information desk. Entryways to the left, right, and ahead are arched. To the right is a corridor with closed rooms and closets and a water fountain. Ahead is a room that comprises the full width of the building and half the depth of the building with a white marble statue of Joseph Warren in the center of the room against the back wall.

Burton and his sons repaired and sold watches, clocks, jewelry, and spectacles in this building for nearly 50 years.<br /><br />Many objects in this room appear in Burton's ledger, reproduced at right. Archeologists discovered the marbles, inkwell, and slate pencil. Burton descendants donated the ledger, safe, workbench, and watch parts. Below is an 1875 Deed of Trust that provides clues to other shop contents:<br /><br />\"...

You can drive to this location on your own.<br /> <br /> Bolivar Heights witnessed more battle action than any other location at Harpers Ferry. The first battle of the Civil War at Harpers Ferry occurred at Bolivar Heights on October 16, 1861, exactly two years after the commencement of the John Brown Raid. Alarmed by Union forces in the new Confederacy, especially along the Potomac River, a Confederate force under Col. Turner Ashby struck Union Col. John Geary's men at Bolivar Heights. Many Confederates were angry over the Union seizure of a local flour mill, which provoke some of the fighting but soon after the Confederate attack, Geary held the location and forced a Confederate retreat.<br /> <br /> Confederate Commander Stonewall Jackson's arrival produced the second battle at Bolivar Heights on May 30, 1862 during Jackson's famous Valley Campaign. Jackson had routed all Union soldiers in the Shenandoah Valley, except those at Harpers Ferry. Alarmed at Jackson's successes, Washington reinforced the Union forces at Harpers Ferry by sending Brig. Gen. Rufus B. Saxton to Bolivar Heights to defend the Union position. Jackson attacked Bolivar Heights during a ferocious thunderstorm, but Saxton's position on Camp Hill was held and Jackson retired under the cover of darkness. Siege cannon from the Naval Battery on Maryland Heights plummeted Jackson's men as they advanced across the heights through the town of Bolivar, damaging numerous homes.<br /> <br /> The third time Bolivar Heights witnessed action also involved Stonewall Jackson's men. During the Battle of Harpers Ferry, September 12-15, 1862, Jackson forced a final stand atop Bolivar Heights with the Union forces. Jackson's artillery pummeled the heights from three directions, Maryland Heights, Loudoun Heights, and School House Ridge. On the night of the 14th, he sent Commander A.P. Hill around the southern flank of the heights, which forced the Union garrison to surrender. The formal surrender of nearly 12,700 Union soldiers, the largest capitulation of Union forces during the Civil War, occurred on Bolivar Heights.<br /> <br /> The fourth time Bolivar Heights experienced combat occurred during Confederate General Robert E. Lee's advance toward Gettysburg. Lee sent a column of men to maneuver the Union out of Harpers Ferry, but the Union forcers offered minimal resistance and the Union retreated behind the big guns on Maryland Heights. Bolivar Heights would be blasted from Maryland Heights during the last week of June 1863 and the indiscriminate shelling created havoc in the community, which wrecked civilian homes.<br /> <br /> The fifth and final time Bolivar Heights was a battlefield occurred during Confederate Commander Jubal Early's invasion of the North during the end of June into the first week of July 1864. Early's main column contended with Maryland Heights, north of the Potomac, and sent a detachment of forces to seize Bolivar Heights along with Harpers Ferry from the west. The Union repeated their tactic of the previous year, offering limited resistance on Bolivar Heights, and instead turned toward the siege cannon on Maryland Heights to pulverize the Confederate invaders. Once again, Bolivar Heights and the town suffered extensive damage from bombardment.<br /> <br /> When Bolivar Heights was not a battlefield, it was a campground. Bolivar Heights' gentle, sweeping slopes first were used by Jackson during the spring of 1861. Here Jackson encamped and drilled the 1st Virginia Brigade, which became the famous \"Stonewall\" Brigade. Jackson gained his familiarity with the topography and terrain of Bolivar Heights during this formative period, which enabled him to use this knowledge to his advantage during the Battle of Harpers Ferry in 1862.<br /> <br /> The largest encampment on Bolivar Heights occurred following the Battle of Antietam. The entire 2nd Corps of the Army of the Potomac, numbering nearly 15,000 men, lived on Bolivar Heights for nearly six weeks before departing for the Fredericksburg Campaign during the first week of November 1862. During this time, Professor Thaddeus Lowe raised his gas-filled balloon to observe Confederate movements in the Shenandoah Valley. In addition, the Union troops built extensive earthworks along the length of the ridge, trying to make Bolivar Heights more defensible. Bolivar Heights has a lower elevation than Maryland and Loudoun Heights, which makes it easier to approach through the Shenandoah Valley.<br /> <br /> Bolivar Heights also was the site of the largest corral and wagon yard in the Shenandoah Valley during the Civil War. During Union Maj. Gen. Philip H. Sheridan's Shenandoah Valley Campaign of 1864, Sheridan converted Bolivar Heights into a temporary corral for thousands of mules and hundreds of quartermaster wagons, waiting to transport supplies and munitions south. Bolivar Heights also became a temporary graveyard. Hundreds of Union soldiers died at Harpers Ferry from disease and most were buried on Bolivar Heights. These remains were removed after the war and reinterred at the Antietam National Cemetery.</p>", "audioDescription": "Some of the best views of the Blue Ridge Mountains, Potomac River water gap, and the Shenandoah Valley.

White painted slatted vents are on the sides near the top of the tower and, underneath those, mid-way up the tower, are diamond shaped windows. And the main entrance is at the base of the tower on the side perpendicular to Jackson Street, facing Fillmore Street. A metal wheelchair ramp lined with handrails on either side has been installed over the original stone stoop. The double door is painted white with a half-round window above. Just over the arched window is a red stone carved with the words: Curtis Freewill Baptist Church, 1894.<br /><br />Along the wall to the left of the tower are 4 rectangular windows inset with colorful stained-glass squares and names written along the top. The names face the inside so they appear backwards to the outside viewer. Two doors are set into the basement level along this side and uneven stone stairs lead down from the brick walkway. A parking lot is to the left of the church.<br /><br />Along the side facing Jackson Street, underneath the diamond window in the tower is a half-circle window. To the right of the tower are three arch-top windows inset with colorful stained-glass squares and names written along the top. The center window is double the width of the other two windows and is 5 feet tall. It is inset with two crosses and the word \"Morrell\" is visible at the top.<br /><br />To the right of the front stoop is a two-foot tall square brick base with a pentagon-shaped plaque mounted on top.

Please \u201ctake only pictures, leave only footprints\u201d so others have a chance to discover what you have during your trip.</p> <hr /> <p>Certain caves are closed to protect bats. Please check with a ranger for current closures.<br /> <br /> <strong>You Can Help Protect Bats!</strong><br /> Learn about white-nose syndrome and get screened before you enter caves.<br /> Lava Beds provides critical habitat throughout the year for large, stable populations of at least 14 species of bats. During the summer, some caves are closed to protect maternal bat colonies where mothers raise thousands of tiny, vulnerable bat pups on the ceiling. Other caves may contain groups of hibernating bats in winter, which can die if awakened often.<br /> <br /> <strong>What to Do if You See Bats?</strong><br /> Stop talking, shine your light away from the bats, and leave the area as quickly and quietly as possible. Note about how many bats there are and where they are, so you can tell a Ranger. Your information will help us better protect these important, fascinating animals.</p> <hr /> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><strong>Cave Softly</strong><br /> Please care for these fragile, amazing environments and cave life by following these rules during your visit:<br /> \u2022 Stay on available trails<br /> \u2022 Leave no trace of your visit behind\u2014do not eat, drink, smoke, or leave trash<br /> \u2022 Do not use caves as bathrooms, use a \u201cwag bag\u201d and pee bottle<br /> \u2022 Formations made of lava, calcite, and ice can be permanently damaged\u2014<br /> cave slowly and carefully and do not touch<br /> \u2022 Do not touch hydrophobic bacterial mats\u2014they are easily damaged and take decades to regrow<br /> \u2022 Use electric flashlights, not carbide or gas lamps<br /> \u2022 Do not touch paintings or cultural artifacts, as they are easily damaged<br /> \u2022 Observe closures to protect bats, and do not disturb any cave life you see<br /> \u2022 Pets are not permitted in caves<br /> <br /> <strong>Cave Safely</strong><br /> \u2022 Wear Appropriate Safety Gear - Prevent injury by wearing long sleeves, pants and closed-toed shoes or boots. Gloves and kneepads are recommended in difficult caves.<br /> \u2022 Protect Your Head - Use bicycle, construction, or other types of helmets. Bump hats are sold at the Visitor Center.<br /> \u2022 Bring Enough Light - Each person should carry at least one flashlight with extra batteries (and bulbs if available). Three flashlights per person are ideal. Flashlights are loaned free of charge during hours of operation at the Visitor Center.<br /> \u2022 Wear Warm Clothing - Most caves are about 55 \u00b0F (13 \u00b0C) year-round. Caves with ice are colder.<br /> \u2022 Know Yourself and Your Group - Choose caves suitable for everyone in your group. Don\u2019t push beyond anyone\u2019s limits. Children and seniors should be able to walk safely on their own. Caves are not appropriate places for infants.<br /> \u2022 Explore as a Group - Tell a friend or family member where you are going and when you expect to return. If you must go alone, choose easier caves and carry three flashlights.<br /> \u2022 Know Your Route - Be observant, and look back at junctions and landmarks to make mental notes. A book of cave maps can be purchased in the Visitor Center\u2014learn to read map symbols before you go.

Drive-in campgrounds are closed from mid-October to mid-May.<br /> <br /> <strong>Backcountry Winter Regulations</strong></p> <ul> <li>Backcountry winter campers need a reservation AND a permit (see the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/piro/planyourvisit/backcountry.htm\">Backcountry Camping page</a>\u00a0for instructions).</li> <li>Winter backcountry camping is permitted\u00a0<strong>only</strong>\u00a0in existing backcountry sites.\u00a0<strong>Dispersed winter camping is NOT allowed.</strong></li> <li>Snowmobiles can access the main parking lots and trailheads where campers then snowshoe or ski to the backcountry sites.</li> <li>Locating backcountry sites in deep snow may require use of GPS coordinates.</li> <li>Use of stoves is recommended - campfires are not permitted unless you build them in established metal fire rings, which may be difficult to find in deep snow. Finding dry down and dead wood will also be difficult.</li> <li>Overnight camping in parking lots is not permitted.</li> <li>Snow is not soil! Since human waste cannot be buried in winter, you will need to\u00a0<strong>pack out all human waste and toilet paper</strong>.<br /> \u00a0</li> </ul> <strong>Your Safety Comes First!</strong><br /> As you can imagine, it's important to come for a winter visit completely prepared! This is especially true for winter camping, which can be a challenging experience.<br /> <br /> An unexpected slip into a creek, the loss of a tarp in a blizzard, or a broken ski binding can quickly spell disaster. The old scout adage of \u201cBe Prepared\u201d is the best advice. Park staff encourage you to carefully plan your winter camping excursion into the park. Here are a few helpful suggestions:<br /> \u00a0 <ul> <li>Before you leave home, let someone know where you are going, how long you plan to be out, a description of your vehicle, where it will be parked, and when you plan to return.\u00a0<strong>Write It Down!</strong></li> <li>Take plenty of liquids and snacks or food along with you ... maybe a little to spare in case something should happen.</li> <li>Take repair supplies for your method of travel (skis, snowshoes, or snowmobile), and camping equipment.</li> <li>Don\u2019t expect your cell phone to work in the park. Many areas do not receive reception due to a lack of towers, cloudy conditions, hilly topography and heavy forest cover.</li> <li>Know the local weather forecast and watch the weather. Lake-effect snow can occur at any time. A southeast or northeast wind will often preceed a heavy snowfall. Expect white-out conditions.</li> <li>Take a compass and map and know how to use them. It is easy to get turned around in portions of the lakeshore when the days are short and the clouds block the sun.</li> <li>Realize that the park ranger staff is reduced in winter and response times are extended due to winter conditions.</li> </ul> <p><br /> Having considered all of this, remember that winter is one of the most incredible seasons at the lakeshore. You will likely see very few people and will be able to enjoy a type of solitude unknown at other times of the year. Happy camping!</p> <br /> \u00a0<br /> \u00a0", "audioDescription": "", "isPassportStampLocation": "0", "passportStampLocationDescription": "", "passportStampImages": [], "managedByUrl": "", "isOpenToPublic": "1", "isMapPinHidden": "0", "npmapId": "", "geometryPoiId": "", "isManagedByNps": "1", "amenities": [], "managedByOrg": "", "quickFacts": [{"id": "5C252B96-2DEB-4EF4-91D1-B5D2B202FCD7", "value": "Winter camping is allowed in designated backcountry sites, by reservation through Recreation.gov", "name": "Location"}], "location": "", "locationDescription": "", "credit": "", "multimedia": []}

A green rectangular sign with white lettering reading \"Industry Museum\" hangs above the entrance to the museum. Inside, on the right, nineteenth century industrial machinery for making weaponry is displayed behind wooden railing, including milling machines, spindle drill presses, rifling machines, and barrel-turning lathes. Panels describe the machinery: \"Lock, Stock, and Barrel: The federal armories at Harpers erry and Springfield, Massachusetts, were among the first machine operated industries in the United States. Workers in the armories used many labor saving machines to produce the three major components of the musket: the lock, the stock, and the barrel. This exhibit shows representative examples of machines used in the 1850s. All were driven by water power, transmitted to the machine through pulleys and leather belts.\" \"Stock: The wooden stock of the musket was the first component manufactured by mass production machines. The duplicating lathe, sometimes called a Blanchard lathe for its inventor, quickly turned out walnut stocks identical to the pattern.\" \"Barrel: The barrel of a musket required exacting production techniques. The bore had to be a uniform diameter, and the metal free from flaws. A special type of machine called a barrel-turning lathe smoothed the exterior of the barrel and cut the correct taper from breech to muzzle.\" \"Rifling Machine: With the advent of rifled muskets, twisting grooves were cut inside the barrel with a rifling machine. A bullet fired from a rifled barrel spirals in flight, giving it greater accuracy over long distances.\" On the opposite wall from the entrance, a display shows an iron stove pipe, two barrels, a small basket, and an iron fence. On the left side of the room, a large illustration labeled \"Virginius and Hall's Islands, 1857\" depicts a cluster of buildings along the Shenandoah River from a overlook.

The tower extends 23 feet underground and is anchored in bedrock. A brick oil building and fog signal building were built in the 1890s. All of the buildings on site, along with the tower and keepers' quarters, make up the\u00a0<em>light station</em>.<br /> <br /> The original keepers' dwelling was attached to the light tower in the back. In 1909, a new residence was built for the head keeper and the existing building expanded so it could accommodate two assistant keepers and their families. One family lived upstairs and one downstairs, with separate entrances. In 1945 the U.S. Coast Guard took over, replacing the civilian keepers. In total, the light station was continually staffed for 84 years, until the Coast Guard left in 1958.<br /> <br /> A third-order Fresnel lens reflected the first light, which was fueled initially by lard oil and then by kerosene. The fixed white beam could be seen 17 miles out on the lake. The lighthouse became fully automated in 1958 and transferred from the Coast Guard to the National Park Service in 1968. The lighthouse still operates - a smaller, solar-powered light now sits on the catwalk railing and shines over Lake Superior every evening.<br /> \u00a0 <p><strong>Visiting the Au Sable Light Station</strong><br /> To visit the Au Sable Light Station, travel to the Hurricane River Campground located 12 miles west of Grand Marais on Alger County Road H-58. Park in the day use parking area near the bridge.<br /> <br /> It is a 1.5 mile walk (one way) to the lighthouse. From the parking lot, walk east through the campground from the picnic area near the Hurricane River mouth. The trail continues past the campground on the historic U.S. Coast Guard access road to the light station. Be alert for occasional staff vehicle traffic. On the beach below the trail, exposed shipwreck remains dot the shoreline. Watch for the signs and steps to the beach along the access road. Pets are permitted on the access road to the light station and on the station grounds. Bicycles are\u00a0<u>not</u>\u00a0permitted on this road. There is drinking water available during the summer months and a toilet year-round at the light station.<br /> <br /> <strong>NOTE:\u00a0On hot, humid days in summer with a south wind, biting flies in this area can be fierce and can ruin your visit to the light station. Consider wearing loose-fitting long pants and socks before starting down the trail.</strong></p> <br /> <strong>Summer Lighthouse Tours</strong><br /> Au Sable Lighthouse tours are scheduled Wednesday through Sunday from mid-June through the end of September or through early October (as staffing permits).
