James, Jr., was born on March 18, 1920, in Kansas City, Missouri. James grew up with his mother in Kansas City. His father died when he was very young. Not much is known about James\u2019s life in Kansas City. He was drafted into the U.S. Army in September 1942. Before he shipped out overseas, he married Valcenie James. They didn\u2019t have time for a proper honeymoon or pictures before he left.<br /> <br /> For the first two years of James\u2019s service he, like many African Americans, worked in supply and service roles. These jobs included setting up supply depots, unloading ships, cooking, and serving food in mess halls. However, in December 1944, Lieutenant General John C.H. Lee, Deputy Commander of U.S. forces in the European theaters of operations, recognized that there were too many African Americans in supply positions but not enough soldiers on the front lines. Lee wanted to change this imbalance by integrating units in Europe on a one-for-one basis. Many generals, including General Dwight D. Eisenhower, oppose this one-for-one replacement of white soldiers with Black soldiers.<br /> <br /> On December 26, 1944, the official call for Black volunteers in service units to transfer to white fighting units was released with Eisenhower\u2019s approval. The response by men in service units was overwhelming. More than 4,500 African American men applied in the first two months of the program. Unable to accommodate everyone who requested the transfer, the Army accepted 2,500. James was one of the soldiers selected for combat replacement training. Like others completing this training, James was placed in an African American platoon and attached to an all-white regiment. These African Americans were known as the 5th Platoon.<br /> <br /> After completing training on March 18, 1945, James\u2019s birthday, he was assigned to the 5th Platoon, Company G, 413th Infantry Regiment, 104th Infantry Division. The division was known as the Timberwolf Division, because it was originally formed in the Pacific Northwest. James\u2019s 5th Platoon was led by Lieutenant Armand J. Serrabella, from Brooklyn, New York. Serrabella was one of the 413th Infantry\u2019s most experienced officers, having received two Purple Hearts.<br /> <br /> James and the rest of the 5th Platoon entered combat for the first time on March 20, 1945, near Cologne, Germany. They, along with other U.S. forces, were slowly pushing back the German forces. Near the town of Paderborn, James led a rifle squad in pursuit of German SS Troops. James\u2019s squad, along with the help of two others, were able to gain an advantage and kill and capture 40 SS troops. The 413th continued its drive deeper into Germany toward the Weser River.<br /> <br /> On April 7, James\u2019s unit crossed the Weser River near Lippoldsberg, Germany. He went ahead of his unit to scout enemy positions. During his mission, he was pinned down by heavy enemy fire and was unable to return to his unit for more than an hour. He then ran back to his unit to deliver his observations. As the men of the 5th Platoon advanced to Lippoldsberg, they drew fire from multiple German positions. SS troops fired from every available window, doorway, and opening toward the unit. Lieutenant Serrabella was hit in the chest by machine-gun fire and immediately fell. James immediately left cover to attend to Serrabella. While trying to help Serrabella, James was shot and killed instantly.<br /> <br /> In September 1945, James\u2019s widow, Valcenie James, accepted the Distinguished Service Cross that he posthumously received. He was buried in Netherlands American Cemetery and Memorial, Plot P, Row 9, Grave 9 in Margraten, Netherlands.<br /> <br /> In the late 1980s, the Department of Defense began to study the issue of why no African Americans were awarded the Medal of Honor during World Wars I and II. The investigation looked at historical documents including Distinguished Service Cross paperwork. It was determined that Black soldiers had been denied consideration for the Medal of Honor in World War II because of their race. They put forward a total of seven men who deserved the Medal of Honor for their actions. Willy F. James, Jr., was one of them. President Bill Clinton posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor to James on January 13, 1997. The award was presented to Valcenie James.<br /> <br /> Private First Class Willy F. James, Jr.\u2019s Medal of Honor citation reads:<br /> \u201cFor conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty: Private First Class Willy F. James, Jr. Distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism at the risk of his own life on 7 April 1945 in the Weser River Valley, in the vicinity of Lippoldsberg, Germany. On 7 April 1945, Company G, 413 Infantry, fought its way across the Weser River in order to establish a crucial bridgehead. The company then launched a fierce attack against the town of Lippoldsberg, possession of which was vital to securing and expanding the important bridgehead. Private First Class James was first scout of the lead squad in the assault platoon. The mission of the unit was to seize and secure a group of houses on the edge of town, a foothold from which the unit could launch an attack on the rest of the town. Far out in front, Private First Class James was the first to draw enemy fire. His platoon leader came forward to investigate, but poor visibility made it difficult for Private First Class James to point out enemy positions with any accuracy. Private First Class James volunteered to go forward to fully reconnoiter the enemy situation. Furious crossfire from enemy snipers and machine guns finally pinned down Private First Class James after making his way forward approximately 200 yards across open terrain. Lying in an exposed position for more than an hour, Private First Class James intrepidly observed the enemy\u2019s positions which were given away by the fire Private First Class James was daringly drawing upon himself. Then, with utter indifference to his personal safety, in a storm of enemy small arms fire, Private First Class James made his way back more than 300 yards across open terrain under enemy observation to his platoon positions, and gave a full, detailed report on the enemy disposition. The unit worked out a new plan on maneuver based on Private First Class James\u2019 information. The gallant soldier volunteered to lead a squad in an assault on the key house in the group that formed the platoon objective. He made his way forward, leading his squad in the assault on the strongly held enemy positions in the building and designating targets accurately and continuously as he moved along. While doing so, Private First Class James saw his platoon leader shot down by enemy snipers. Hastily designating and coolly orienting a leader in his place, Private First Class James instantly went to the aid of his platoon leader, exposing himself recklessly to the incessant enemy fire. As he was making his way across open ground, Private First Class James was killed by a burst from an enemy machine gun. Private First Class James\u2019 extraordinary heroic action in the face of withering enemy fire provided the disposition of enemy troops to his platoon. Inspired to the utmost by Private First Class James\u2019 self-sacrifice, the platoon sustained the momentum of the assault and successfully accomplished its mission with a minimum of causalities. Private First Class James contributed very definitely to the success of his battalion in the vitally important combat operation of establishing and expanding a bridgehead over the Weser River. His fearless, self-assigned actions, far above and beyond the normal call of duty, exemplify the finest traditions of the American combat soldier and reflect with highest credit upon Private First Class James and the Armed Forces of the United States.\u201d<br /> \u00a0", "geometryPoiId": "", "firstName": "Willy", "middleName": "F.", "lastName": "James, Jr.", "quickFacts": [{"id": "F7A67C96-173F-4675-B374-7E3D3A1818B2", "value": "WW2 Buffalo Soldier and Medal of Honor Recipient", "name": "Significance"}, {"id": "7F812988-263D-4233-81CF-6E7A89621004", "value": "Kansas City, Missouri", "name": "Place of Birth"}, {"id": "5E9CA71F-E57B-4222-BBD3-1A225E2351C2", "value": "March 18, 1920", "name": "Date of Birth"}, {"id": "3905576C-509A-49F5-A8EE-B4CF14529BBB", "value": "Lippoldsberg, Germany", "name": "Place of Death"}, {"id": "8F2D2A55-2E87-4DF3-8E09-8520B5A5B7FD", "value": "April 7, 1945", "name": "Date of Death"}, {"id": "E0CEB20D-33EA-4A2E-8444-DE8D7D572CA7", "value": "Margraten, Netherlands", "name": "Place of Burial"}, {"id": "87BFD41C-3E7B-45DA-9CE0-1AA7C093B2A5", "value": "Netherlands American Cemetery and Memorial", "name": "Cemetery Name"}], "credit": ""}

While pursuing a classical education at both Columbia and Princeton, he studied medicine privately, attending lectures by Samuel Bard and Benjamin Rush. In 1790 he entered the Medical School of the University of Pennsylvania. Two years later, he continued his medical studies at the University of Edinburgh. While in Scotland, Hosack paid a visit to his father\u2019s birthplace, Elgin, where he spent time with relatives, as well as the Duke and Duchess of Gordon, who were designing the landscape gardens at their home in the manner of Lancelot \u201cCapability\u201d Brown.

Dr. Chung used her influence to support the Allied war effort. She lobbied for the creation of the WAVES, the U.S. Naval Women\u2019s Reserve. Although she faced prejudice because of her race, gender, and sexuality, Dr. Chung forged a distinctive path for herself throughout her life.</p> <h4>Early Life and Career</h4> <p>Margaret Jessie Chung was born in Santa Barbara, California in 1889. Her parents had immigrated from China as young children. The family were devout Christians. Margaret was the oldest of eleven children and spent a lot of time raising her younger siblings. Intent on becoming a medical missionary to China, she worked her way through college and medical school at the University of Southern California. As a medical student, Chung wore masculine clothing and referred to herself as \u201cMike.\u201d<br /> <br /> Dr. Chung applied to be a medical missionary after her graduation, but the Presbyterian missionary board rejected her because of her race. However, she did not give up on becoming a healer. She worked as a surgical nurse and then as an intern and medical resident in the Chicago area.[1] In 1919, she returned to her family and home state of California. She treated victims of industrial accidents as a surgeon at the Santa Fe Railroad Hospital in Los Angeles.[2] She also started a private practice ministering to the actors and musicians of the growing Hollywood entertainment industry. Soon Dr. Chung became well-known as a physician to the stars.</p> <h4>San Francisco</h4> <p>In 1922, Dr. Chung moved to San Francisco and opened a clinic in Chinatown. She especially wanted to help Chinese women patients. But many of the neighborhood\u2019s residents were skeptical of Western medicine. They were even more suspicious of a young, single woman doctor who dressed in masculine clothes. Many Chinatown residents treated Dr. Chung as an outsider. Rumors circulated that she was a lesbian.<br /> <br /> Dr. Chung was more successful in attracting non-Chinese patients. Her \u201coutsider\u201d status actually made this easier. Along with other Chinese Americans during this period, Dr. Chung cultivated an \u201cOriental\u201d image to appeal to white visitors who were looking for \u201cexotic\u201d Chinese medical treatments.<br /> <br /> Other patients, such as the lesbian poet and journalist Elsa Gidlow, chose her because they suspected Dr. Chung \u201cmight be a sister lesbian.\u201d[3] While Chung never claimed that label, she did have several romantic and intimate relationships with women, including Gidlow and the entertainer Sophie Tucker. Intent on protecting herself from damaging rumors about her sexuality, she traveled outside Chinatown to frequent the bars, speakeasies, and cafes that formed a growing queer subculture in San Francisco\u2019s North Beach neighborhood.</p> <h4>\u201cMom\u201d Chung and her Adopted Sons</h4> <p>In the 1930s, Dr. Chung\u2019s life changed again. The Japanese invasion of China and the Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945) sparked new American sympathy for Chinese people. In this environment, a U.S. Navy Reserves ensign named Steven G. Bancroft reached out to Dr. Chung to ask if she could help him get a commission in the Chinese military. She had no such influence, but she invited Bancroft and some of his pilot friends to her home in San Francisco for dinner. \u00a0<br /> <br /> Dr. Chung and Bancroft\u2019s group hit it off. They ate dinner together almost every night and went on camping and hunting trips. They started to joke about how to describe their unusual bond. As Chung recalled in her autobiography, one night one of the pilots \u201cspoke up and said, \u2018Gee, you are as understanding as a mother, and we are going to adopt you; but, hell, you are an old maid, and you haven\u2019t got a father for us.\u2019 Feeling facetious that night, I cracked back at them, \u2018Well, that makes you a lot of fair-haired bastards, doesn\u2019t it?\u2019\u201d The name stuck.<br /> <br /> Dr. Chung volunteered to serve as a front-line surgeon during the Sino-Japanese War. Instead, she was asked to secretly recruit pilots for a unit that would become famous as the \u201cFlying Tigers.\u201d These squadrons of American pilots from the Marines, Air Corps, and Navy flew under Chinese colors.\u00a0<br /> <br /> By the end of WWII, Chung\u2019s surrogate family had swelled to more than 1500. Aviators were part of the \u201cFair-Haired Bastards\u201d group, while submarine men were called \u201cGolden Dolphins.\u201d All others were known as \u201cKiwis.\u201d Many of Chung\u2019s \u201cchildren\u201d were American servicemen, but Hollywood stars like John Wayne and Ronald Reagan were also included.[4] So were politicians and top military officials like Fleet Admirals Chester W. Nimitz and William \u201cBull\u201d Halsey Jr. The pilot and adventurer Amelia Earhart was one of her few \u201cbastard daughters.\u201d[5]</p> <h4>World War II</h4> <p>During World War II, Dr. Chung used her influence and patriotism to work for the Allied war effort. She supported her \u201csons\u201d at the front by sending them letters and Christmas gifts and connecting them to each other. She hosted weekly Saturday dinners at her home for family members and their guests. Her fame grew and her adopted family received significant media coverage as an example of American patriotism.<br /> <br /> Dr. Chung also pressed for greater inclusion of women in the United States military. She pushed for legislation to create the WAVES (Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service), a reserve corps for women in the Navy. She drew on her connections to government officials and her network of adopted children to lobby behind the scenes. Although she succeeded in getting the WAVES established in 1942, she did not get the proper credit for her role in its creation. Her repeated applications to join the corps were rejected because of her race and rumors about her sexuality.<br /> <br /> Dr. Margaret Chung died from cancer on January 5, 1959, at the age of 69.<br /> \u00a0</p> <h4>Notes</h4> <p>[1] While in Chicago, Dr. Chung served as the resident assistant in psychiatry at the first Juvenile Psychopathic Institute of the State of Illinois at Cook County Hospital.

He moved to Las Cruces, New Mexico around 1918 and was active in the community. Years later he filed for a homestead claim outside of the city on the East Mesa.<br /> <br /> His parents were John and Margaret (Jackson) Hibler. John Hibler was born in the mid-1840s in Sumter County, Alabama. Margaret Jackson was born in Texas a few years after John. It is likely both of Cortez Hibler\u2019s parents were enslaved during their childhoods. Since many freed slaves took on the last name of their enslaver, John was likely enslaved by W. H. Hibbler in Sumter County.<br /> <br /> In 1867, John Hibler registered to vote in Sumter County, but soon moved to Texas. By 1870, John and Margaret were married and living in Falls County, Texas. Ten years later, their household included eight children of their own, plus a niece and nephew.<br /> <br /> Cortez Hibler married Lou Ella Fields on February 11, 1899, in Falls County, Texas. They appear together in the 1900 census with her son from her first marriage, James Fields. Something seems to have happened with the marriage as she does not appear with Cortez again until 1918. The 1910 census shows Cortez as a single roomer working as a laborer in Fort Worth, Texas.<br /> <br /> Cortez\u2019 older brother Daniel Hibler settled in Las Cruces around 1909 and worked as a chef for the Don Bernardo Hotel. Cortez followed his example and settled in Las Cruces. During this time, he reconnected with Lou Ella remarrying her (Mrs. L. E. Bragg), in Las Cruces, on February 23, 1918. The couple did not have any children together. Cortez\u2019s WWI draft card dated September 12, 1918, shows him to be employed as a janitor for First National Bank in Las Cruces. The 1920 census shows the couple and a lodger living in a rented house with Cortez\u2019s occupation listed as general labor.<br /> <br /> The Hiblers were active in the Las Cruces community. Cortez and his brother Daniel were the proprietors of The Jitney Caf\u00e9, located on Main Street. Cortez, Daniel, and Lou Ella also played a role in founding Phillips Chapel, a Colored Methodist Episcopal (CME) Church. The Hiblers along with others, rented a building where the congregation could meet until the Phillips Chapel was built. The Phillips Chapel served as the black school for Las Cruces from 1924 until 1934 when the Booker T. Washington School opened.\u00a0Cortez was active in Republican politics and was a member of the \"Hill for Governor Club.\" Dr. C. L. Hill was the Republican nominee in the 1922 New Mexico gubernatorial race.<br /> <br /> By 1930, the Hiblers lived on their 640-acre stock raising homestead (Sec. 9, T. 22S, R. 2E, New Mexico Prime Meridian). The homestead was in an area called the East Mesa northeast of the City of Las Cruces. As a stock-raising homestead entry, the homesteaders only gained ownership of the surface rights to the land. The government maintained the mineral rights.<br /> <br /> Homesteaders had the opportunity to gain ownership of the land, but the odds of earning a sufficient living from 640 acres of desert land were slim. The East Mesa area is very arid, receiving an average of 8-10 inches of rain per year. Contemporary estimates suggest that a section of land in this area could support 5-10 grazing cows. Cortez listed his occupation as farmer in the 1930 census but likely relied on other forms of income to survive. Still, the Hiblers and many others (including at least 25 other Black homesteaders) proved up their homesteads on the East Mesa.<br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Cortez Hibler died on April 1,<font color=\"#337ab7\"><span style=\"letter-spacing: -0.25px;\"><b> </b></span></font>1934, before proving up the homestead claim. Lou Ella Hibler received a patent for the land on June 28, 1937. A few months later, she married William M. Cherry. What happened to Lou Ella after that is unknown.<br /> <br /> A fellow homesteader, William F. Isaacks, took ownership of the Hibler Homestead. Isaacks had received a patent for 160 acres a few miles NW of the Hibler homestead in 1910, prior to the 1916 Stock Raising Homestead Act. The Hibler land stayed in the Isaack family until being sold to developers in 2004.<br /> <br /> Today, the homestead land is within the city limits of Las Cruces, NM.\u00a0Development has reached the north edge of the homestead where portions of the Red Hawk Golf Course and an adjoining residential area lie on the Hibler homestead land. Of the physical improvements made to the land an earthen tank used to capture water at the northeast corner of the section remains. <h4><b>Sources:</b></h4> Administrator. \u201cBlacks in a Border County.\u201d <i>Frontera Norte Sur</i>, New Mexico State University.

Clark's second-in-command, Captain Joseph Bowman, kept a journal throughout the entirety of the march to Vincennes. It can found\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.in.gov/history/2964.htm\">here</a>. Although this was Clark's most dramatic accomplishment, he continued his exertions on behalf of the American cause in the West during the entire war. Nine months after capturing Fort Sackville, Clark wrote a letter to George Mason chronicling his adventures against the British and the daring mid-winter march. That letter can be found\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.in.gov/history/2963.htm\">here</a>. These efforts included building forts on the Mississippi and Ohio rivers, repelling a British-led Indian attack in the Illinois country, and leading two major expeditions that destroyed the major Shawnee towns in the Ohio country. Despite these accomplishments, the second half of his life witnessed a sad decline in his fortunes and health.</p> <p>During September 1783, the Revolutionary War officially ended with the signing of the Treaty of Paris and Clark returned to private life. Following the war, Clark served as chairman of a board of commissioners that allotted lands across the Ohio River from Louisville to those individuals who had taken part in his 1778 and 1779 campaigns. He also was appointed a commissioner to make treaties with tribes north of the Ohio River who were continuing their raids into Kentucky. During 1786, after it became apparent that the treaties were ineffective, Clark was requested by Kentucky and Virginia authorities to lead a retaliatory expedition against the tribes along the Wabash River. From the beginning, however, Clark was plagued by questions of his authority and by the unruly behavior of the troops. After proceeding along the Wabash River north of Vincennes, a large portion of the men mutinied. Clark returned to Vincennes and established a garrison to protect this outpost before returning to Kentucky.</p> <p>This expedition was the low point of Clark's career. Soon he became the victim of a deliberate campaign to ruin his reputation. Clark attempted to raise his reputation by publishing his memoir of the Vincennes campaign, ten years after the capture of the fort. That can be found\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.in.gov/history/2425.htm\">here</a>. Hounded, too, by creditors, Clark turned to a series of projects in an attempt to recoup his fortune. The first of these undertakings was to start a colony across the Mississippi River in Spanish Louisiana with the consent of the Spanish government. When this consent was not given, Clark made preparations to establish a colony of American adventurers in Spanish territory near Natchez, but President George Washington issued a proclamation against this project. During 1793, Clark agreed to accept a French commission as major general and lead an expedition of American frontiersmen against Spanish Louisiana. This venture also failed when Washington again issued a proclamation against American citizens invading foreign territory. During 1798 the plan was resurrected, but once more came to naught.</p> <p>During 1803, at the age of 51, Clark moved from Louisville across the Ohio River to Clarksville, IN, a town named in his honor. Six years later he suffered a stroke of paralysis and also the amputation of his leg. He returned to Louisville where he lived with his sister, Lucy Croghan, at\u00a0<a href=\"http://locustgrove.org/\">Locust Grove</a>. In 1812, in belated recognition of Revolutionary War services, the General Assembly of Virginia granted Clark a sword and half pay of $400 a year. His health continued to deteriorate and he died on February 13, 1818, at the age of 65. On February 15, a cold and stormy day, Clark's body was laid to rest in a ceremony attended by a large crowd. In his funeral oration, Judge John Rowan succinctly summed up the stature and importance of George Rogers Clark during the critical years on the Trans-Appalachian frontier:\u00a0<strong>\"The mighty oak of the forest has fallen, and now the scrub oaks sprout all around.\"</strong></p>", "geometryPoiId": "", "firstName": "George", "middleName": "Rogers", "lastName": "Clark", "quickFacts": [{"id": "F7A67C96-173F-4675-B374-7E3D3A1818B2", "value": "Revolutionary War", "name": "Significance"}, {"id": "7F812988-263D-4233-81CF-6E7A89621004", "value": "Kentucky", "name": "Place of Birth"}, {"id": "5E9CA71F-E57B-4222-BBD3-1A225E2351C2", "value": "1752", "name": "Date of Birth"}, {"id": "3905576C-509A-49F5-A8EE-B4CF14529BBB", "value": "Kentucky", "name": "Place of Death"}, {"id": "8F2D2A55-2E87-4DF3-8E09-8520B5A5B7FD", "value": "1818", "name": "Date of Death"}], "credit": ""}

In addition to all census years from 1850 to 1930 listing his birth year as 1845, the 1840 Overton County, TN census for his father Joshua Hill lists one male under ten years old; one female under ten years old; one female between ten to twenty-three years old and one male twenty-four to thirty five years old. This information coincides with the 1850 Overton County, TN census that Joshua and Matilda\u2019s two oldest children were Mary Jane Hill born circa 1837 and Allen Parkingham Hill born circa 1841. The 1865 Kansas State census also list Milton\u2019s age as twenty (which the birth year would have been 1845).\u00a0<br /> <br /> Milton\u2019s parents, Joshua and Matilda had nine additional children: Mary Jane Hill-Morgan born 1837 in Overton County, Tennessee and died June 1889 in Bourbon County, Kansas, (her husband John Morgan was one of the witnesses on the Homestead application); Allen Parkingham \u201cPack\u201d Hill born 1841 in Overton County, TN and served in the 1st Kansas Colored and he married Lucy Beck of the Cherokee Nation [documented on the Cherokee Freedmen roll] he died circa 1876; Harrison Hill born circa 1843 in Overton County, TN; Milly Hill-Robinson born circa 1845 in Overton County, TN, died 1899 in Neosho County, KS; Frances Hill born circa 1848 in Overton County, TN; \u00a0Nancy Hill-Ross born April 1854 in Overton County, TN; Julia Hill-Wash born circa 1857 in Overton County, TN; Thomas Hill December 1850 in Overton County, TN and died August 24, 1937 in Bourbon County, KS; Augusta Hill-Anderson (daughter) born circa 1861 in Jasper County, MO.<br /> <br /> Milton, his parents and siblings were all born free and listed as Free Persons of color on early census records. Milton\u2019s grandmother Milly Hill was first enumerated on the 1820 Overton County, TN Census as a Free person of color. Milly Hill was the mother of the following children; Mary \u201cMariah\u201d Hill born circa 1810; Joshua Hill\u00a0born circa 1811 and died 1871 in Bourbon County, KS; Elizabeth \u201cBetsey\u201d Hill (married to Levi Stone however maintained her maiden name Hill) born circa 1820; Thomas Hill born 1824 and died 1896 in Bourbon County, KS; Reuben Hill born circa 1830 and died July 1911 in Bourbon County, KS. By the 1850s, Millie Hill\u2019s children are documented as land owners. Their land situated along the Obed River became known as the Free Hill Community.<br /> <br /> Milton was first married to Mary Robinson and they had the following children: William Harrison born circa 1867 in Bourbon County, KS; Frank Hill born circa 1868 in Bourbon County, KS; Joseph Hill born circa 1869 in Bourbon County, KS; James Hill born circa 1873 in Bourbon County, KS; Hayes Hill born December 1876 in Bourbon County, KS and died 1935 Bourbon County, KS; Johnie Hill born circa 1879 in Bourbon County, KS. After the death of his wife Mary circa 1888, Milton married a woman named Delphy and to this union two children were born, Nannie Hill November 1893 in Bourbon County, KS and Milton \u201cMelton\u201d Hill born April 1897 in Bourbon County, KS.<br /> <br /> Per the 1875 Bourbon County, Kansas state census, Milton is enumerated with his wife Mary and their two sons Harrison (9) and James (2). Additionally three of his sons, Harrison, James and Hayes applied for citizenship in the Cherokee Nation. They were part of an\u00a0application filed by\u00a0their maternal uncle William Henry Robinson dated June 11, 1901, [Cherokee Freedmen Rejected 442].<br /> <br /> The death certificate for Milton Hill and the grave marker lists his birth as May 12, 1838 however based on the 1850 census and subsequent census years, his birth year was 1845.<br /> <br /> The witnesses listed in the land application file were John Morgan (the brother in law of Milton Hill) and David Boss.<br /> <br /> <strong>~ Contributed\u00a0by\u00a0Lyle Gibson</strong><br /> <br /> <img alt=\"A man sits in a black shirt and with crossed arms at his computer and recording gear on the desk behind him.

Before being drafted he worked on the family farm. He was married to Pearl, and they had a daughter named Minnie Lee. He was drafted into the U.S. Army in 1917 at 21 and assigned to the all- Black Company C, 1st Battalion, 371st Infantry regiment. They were organized at Camp Jackson, South Carolina.<br /> <br /> In March 1918, General Pershing assigned the 371st Infantry along with other all-Black regiments including the Harlem Hellfighters to aid the beleaguered French forces during World War I. The French needed combat troops and were accustomed to deploying their own Black colonial troops. While American military leaders warned the French not to treat the 371st Infantry and other African Americans as they did white troops, the French ignored this advice and welcomed them into their fighting force. After they received training with French weapons, the 371st was attached to the 157th French Army, known as the \u201cRed Hand Division.\u201d<br /> <br /> In the early morning hours of September 28, 1918, Corporal Stowers\u2019s company was ordered to take the heavily defended Hill 188, overlooking Ardeuil-et-Montfauxelles in the Ardennes region of France, from the Germans. The Germans initially gave stiff resistance to the American charge. The Germans used mortars, machine guns, and rifle fire. The Americans continued their determined advance up the hill. Stowers and his comrades saw the Germans wave a white flag and try to surrender. The Americans moved closer to the Germans without firing, readying to take the Germans prisoners. At the last moment the Germans jumped back into their trenches and machine-gun fire again raked the Americans. Half of Stowers\u2019s company was killed or wounded including his lieutenant and higher-ranked non-commissioned officers.\u00a0<br /> <br /> Corporal Stowers took command of the depleted company and urged them forward. Stowers and the remaining soldiers took the first German trench and neutralized one machine-gun position. As Stowers was leading his men to the second German trench, he was mortally wounded by German machine-gun fire. As he lay wounded, he urged his company forward to overtake the German position. The men forged ahead and dislodged the Germans from Hill 188. Stowers died there that day. He was buried along with 133 of his comrades at the Meuse-Argonne American Cemetery and Memorial east of Romagne-sous-Montfaucon in France.<br /> <br /> Shortly after Stowers was killed in action he was recommended for the Medal of Honor, but his application was misplaced, and the recommendation was never processed. Stowers\u2019s heroic actions laid dormant in the annals of history until 1988. At that time the Army launched an investigation into why no African Americans were awarded the Medal of Honor in World War I. The investigation determined Stowers\u2019s recommendation had fallen through the cracks. On April 24, 1991, President George H.W. Bush posthumously awarded Corporal Freddie Stowers the Medal of Honor at a White House ceremony. Stowers\u2019s two sisters accepted the award on the family\u2019s behalf.\u00a0<br /> <br /> The award to Stowers prompted the Army to continue to look through the records of World Wars I and II to see if the military had overlooked other African Americans deserving of the Medal of Honor. In total, seven African American World War II veterans were posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor in 1997. Only one other African American soldier who served in World War I, Henry Johnson, has posthumously received the Medal of Honor. His posthumous award occurred in 2015.<br /> <br /> Corporal Freddie Stowers\u2019s Medal of Honor citation reads:<br /> \u201cCorporal Stowers distinguished himself by exceptional heroism on 28 September 1918 while serving as a squad leader in Company C, 371st Infantry Regiment, 93d Division. His company was the lead company during the attack on Hill 188, Champagne Marne Sector, France, during World War I. A few minutes after the attack began, the enemy ceased firing and began climbing up onto the parapets of the trenches, holding up their arms as if wishing to surrender. The enemy\u2019s actions caused the American forces to cease fire and to come out into the open. As the company started forward and when within about 100 meters of the trench line, the enemy jumped back into their trenches and greeted Corporal Stowers\u2019 company with interlocking bands of machine gun fire and mortar fire causing well over fifty percent casualties. Faced with incredible enemy resistance, Corporal Stowers took charge, setting such a courageous example of personal bravery and leadership that he inspired his men to follow him in the attack. With extraordinary heroism and complete disregard of personal danger under devastating fire, he crawled forward leading his squad toward an enemy machine gun nest, which was causing heavy casualties to his company. After fierce fighting, the machine gun position was destroyed, and the enemy soldiers were killed. Displaying great courage and intrepidity Corporal Stowers continued to press the attack against a determined enemy. While crawling forward and urging his men to continue the attack on a second trench line, he was gravely wounded by machine gun fire. Although Corporal Stowers was mortally wounded, he pressed forward, urging on the members of his squad, until he died. Inspired by the heroism and display of bravery of Corporal Stowers, his company continued the attack against incredible odds, contributing to the capture of Hill 188 and causing heavy enemy casualties. Corporal Stowers\u2019 conspicuous gallantry, extraordinary heroism, and supreme devotion to his men were well above and beyond the call of duty, follow the finest traditions of military service, and reflect the utmost credit on him and the United States Army.\u201d", "geometryPoiId": "", "firstName": "Freddie", "middleName": "", "lastName": "Stowers", "quickFacts": [{"id": "F7A67C96-173F-4675-B374-7E3D3A1818B2", "value": "African American Soldier, Medal of Honor recipient, WWI", "name": "Significance"}, {"id": "7F812988-263D-4233-81CF-6E7A89621004", "value": "Sandy Springs, South Carolina", "name": "Place of Birth"}, {"id": "5E9CA71F-E57B-4222-BBD3-1A225E2351C2", "value": "January 12, 1896", "name": "Date of Birth"}, {"id": "3905576C-509A-49F5-A8EE-B4CF14529BBB", "value": "Ardeuil-et-Montfauxelles, Departement des Ardennes, Champagne-Ardenne, France", "name": "Place of Death"}, {"id": "8F2D2A55-2E87-4DF3-8E09-8520B5A5B7FD", "value": "September 28, 1918", "name": "Date of Death"}, {"id": "E0CEB20D-33EA-4A2E-8444-DE8D7D572CA7", "value": "Romagne-Sous-Montfaucon, France", "name": "Place of Burial"}, {"id": "87BFD41C-3E7B-45DA-9CE0-1AA7C093B2A5", "value": "Meuse-Argonne American Cemetery and Memorial", "name": "Cemetery Name"}], "credit": ""}

His father died when he was an infant. His mother Eberhardina emigrated to Charleston, South Carolina with her parents, but died of yellow fever when Memminger was four years old. His grandparents placed him in the Orphan\u2019s House of Charleston and, at age 11, he was adopted by Thomas Bennett, a prominent lawyer and the future Governor of South Carolina. At thirteen years old, Memminger entered the South Carolina College in Columbia (which became the University of South Carolina). He excelled in his studies despite his young age. After graduation in 1825, he returned to Charleston to begin a career in law under the tutelage of Mr. Bennett. He was elected to the South Carolina House of Representatives (1836 \u2013 1859) where he reformed the public-school system (which served only white children at the time) by implementing a program of graded schools in Charleston (1854).<br /> <br /> <strong>Memminger in Flat Rock</strong><br /> The built environment of the site, now known as Connemara and designated as Carl Sandburg Home National Historic Site, begins with Christopher Gustav Memminger. He became interested in Flat Rock, North Carolina, when other wealthy Charleston associates started buying land and building \u201csummer homes\u201d in the mountain community. He purchased a large piece of land in 1838 and named the property \u201cRock Hill\u201d for the prominent granite outcroppings near the home. Much of the developed areas of the park that we see today, including the large white house, buildings around the house, lakes, dams and rock walls were constructed by people Memminger hired, and enslaved persons that he owned.<br /> <br /> <strong>Memminger and Slavery</strong><br /> As a lawyer in Charleston, Memminger used his legal expertise to assist clients to purchase and sell enslaved persons, including the purchase and sale of his own enslaved workers. At Rock Hill in Flat Rock, he owned as many as 24 enslaved people (including children), while he lived there. Some had specialized duties and performed the work of carpenters, nursemaids, and butler, such as Robert, who may have been Memminger\u2019s butler. \u00a0Other unnamed persons were referred to as \u201cservants\u201d in ledgers. Two structures he had built at Rock Hill (known today as the \u201cSwedish House\u201d and \u201cWash House\u201d) were used as living and sleeping quarters for the enslaved people who worked there.<br /> <br /> <strong>Memminger and Politics</strong><br /> Initially, Memminger was not a supporter of succession from the Union but, after Lincoln\u2019s election, he became an active member of the Secession Convention of South Carolina and helped write the Provisional Constitution of the Confederate States. In 1861, Confederate President Jefferson Davis appointed Memminger to his Cabinet as Secretary of the Confederate Treasury. His task was daunting; northern blockades prevented the exportation of cotton and rice, which was the South's only means to raise cash. Memminger was eventually forced to implement taxes to support the War effort but this effort was too little too late. He resigned from the Cabinet in July 1864, realizing he could not prevent the collapse of the Confederacy\u2019s finances and retreated to Rock Hill. After the War ended, he resumed his legal career in Charleston. He also began investing in the booming phosphate industry. He continued his work in school reform as a member of the Charleston Public School Board, and later helped reorganize the South Carolina College to become the University of South Carolina. He continued to promote separate schools for whites and blacks. \u00a0\u00a0<br /> <br /> Memminger defended the institution of slavery and black subjugation throughout his life. He lived during the Antebellum culture and economy of slavery, Reconstruction, and Post-Reconstruction. He was re-elected to the South Carolina legislature in 1877, based, in part, on his previous experience in the Legislature and his racial views. He and former Confederates shaped legislation to maintain, protect, and extend the subjugation and exploitation of black people through the restrictive \u201cBlack Codes,\u201d that was passed in South Carolina in 1865. Black codes were designed to limit the freedom of freed slaves and to ensure their availability as a cheap labor force. He clung to a worldview where blacks were inferior to whites. In a letter to President Andrew Johnson, he wrote that \u201cblack people needed white guidance, similar to a master and apprentice relationship, and that they were incapable of political participation or understanding of law.\u201d He and his fellow former Confederates benefitted from the social processes that restored white former slaveholding elites to their former status as the top of southern society with the collapse of Reconstruction. He died at the age of 85 in Charleston (1888) and is buried at St. John in the Wilderness Episcopal Church in Flat Rock.", "geometryPoiId": "", "firstName": "Christopher", "middleName": "Gustav", "lastName": "Memminger", "quickFacts": [{"id": "F7A67C96-173F-4675-B374-7E3D3A1818B2", "value": "Major figure in South Carolina government during reconstruction and part-year resident in Flat Rock, NC", "name": "Significance"}, {"id": "7F812988-263D-4233-81CF-6E7A89621004", "value": "Vaihingen an der Enz, Germany", "name": "Place of Birth"}, {"id": "5E9CA71F-E57B-4222-BBD3-1A225E2351C2", "value": " January 9, 1803", "name": "Date of Birth"}, {"id": "3905576C-509A-49F5-A8EE-B4CF14529BBB", "value": "Flat Rock, NC", "name": "Place of Death"}, {"id": "8F2D2A55-2E87-4DF3-8E09-8520B5A5B7FD", "value": "March 7, 1888", "name": "Date of Death"}, {"id": "E0CEB20D-33EA-4A2E-8444-DE8D7D572CA7", "value": "Flat Rock, NC", "name": "Place of Burial"}, {"id": "87BFD41C-3E7B-45DA-9CE0-1AA7C093B2A5", "value": "St. John in the Wilderness Episcopal Church", "name": "Cemetery Name"}], "credit": ""}

However, he is listed as a voter in 1867 in Bradley County, Arkansas and was the head of a large household with his first wife Dolly in the 1870 Census for Palestine Township<strong><sup>1</sup></strong>. That set of children included Mary H. (b. about 1858), Edward (b. about 1860), John (b. about 1862), Will (b. about 1864), and Lottie (b. about 1869).<br /> <br /> Per the Homestead proof questionnaire, Hampton\u00a0settled the land he would later claim for a homestead in Section 22 with that family around January of 1873. The actual Homestead Application #11408 was filed over a decade later at the Land Office at Camden, Arkansas on 13 September 1884 for 120 acres of largely timberland composed of white oak, pine and hickory.<br /> <br /> From first settlement in 1873 to his testimony as part of his proof packet, Hampton built an all-season log home, smoke house, corn cribs and stables, two cotton houses, plus an additional 18x18 foot dwelling; cleared and fenced 60 acres of the land for cultivating corn and cotton. He also had 2 mules, a horse and 8 head of cattle. At the time of his proof, Hampton noted his family included \u201ca wife and eight children\u201d and that his family had settled with him seventeen years prior. More accurately, during his homestead the couple had at least one more daughter Anna around 1874 and he lost his wife Dolly<strong><sup>2</sup></strong>.\u00a0He married his second wife Jane (also known as Virginia and Janey) Johnson at Bradley County on 5 Nov 1877 and, they added a daughter Lou to the family in 1887<strong><sup>3</sup></strong>.<br /> <br /> Levi Hampton formally proved up the land before the Bradley County Judge in Warren, Arkansas on 9 March 1891, signing by his mark. Close neighbors Sam Trotter and Ryal Trotter (neighboring brothers), an unrelated neighbor Wilson Terry, and Will Newton (the Trotter\u2019s younger half-brother) were called as witnesses. Only Terry was on hand to stand for Hampton and a note in the file asks the government to allow that. The Homestead Certificate #5962 was officially signed 14 July 1891.

He cleared approximately 20 acres of timber and considered it \"ordinary agricultural land\". Riely built a 18x25 home and made improvements. He described his home and\u00a0improvements\u00a0in his Testimony of Claimant form as, \"It is built of pine poles, consisting of two rooms, one front and back room and galley in front worth $50.

He saw \u00a0the improvements (fencing, fields, and buildings) on the farm. Mr. Samuel Johnson (age 30) was a also self-employed farmer living in Dayton*, Amite County and lived three miles from the James Riely\u00a0farm. He knew him for seven years and could attest to the improvements such as the cutting of \u00a0timber,\u00a0a 18x25 dwelling, and a shed room on his farm. Samuel Johnson was the brother-in-law of James Riely\u2019s (Riley) wife (Martha) and married her sister (Laura Jenkins) on January 10, 1884.<br /> <br /> After five years of marriage, James and Martha had four children (Sarah, Minnie, Susanna, and Estelle) as noted in the 1900 US Census. As the cultivation of Riely\u2019s farm grew, so did his family, from four children to six additional children as noted in the 1910 Census (Mary, Eunice, Ida William M, Jeanette, and James S).\u00a0Riely's\u00a080 year old grandmother Margret Anderson also resided with him. By 1920, James was a widow and his children had moved away except for his two sons William M and James S. However, James still owned his farm. James Riley died in 1928 in Amite County at the age of seventy-one.<br /> <br /> *Dayton, Amite County, Mississippi: The town of Crosby has been known by several names throughout its history. Crosby was first named\u00a0Dayton in 1884 in honor of David Day who gave the Railroad\u00a0right-of-way. In 1917 the town's name changed to Stephenson after the\u00a0Foster Creek Lumber & Mfg.

She was enslaved there until she was emancipated.<br /> <br /> Phoebe Ann Bartlett married Shedrick \"Shed\" Franklin, Sr., when they were both enslaved on the same plantation. They were the parents of nine children (Amy, Minty, Betsy, Moses, Corrine, Shedrick, Louisa and Willie). Their daughter, Edy, died at birth in December of 1856 and Shedrick Franklin, Sr., passed away in August of 1885.<br /> <br /> Phoebe Franklin filed her Homestead application #13822 on March 10, 1892. They established continuous residency in 1874 cultivating 6 acres containing a small \"shanty\" house, corn crib, cotton house and outhouse, all valued at $100.\u00a0<br /> <br /> As head of her household, Phoebe and her two youngest children, Louisa\u00a0(about 10 years of age) and Willie (about 9 years of age) resided with her at the time that she initiated her application. She could not read or write and signed her documentation by marking an \"X\".<br /> <br /> In 1892 Phoebe's witnesses to prove up her claim were her neighbors;\u00a0Moses Bureau (also a homesteader), James Banks, Edmund Jackson and George Roberson. These\u00a0four men, in the year 1892, were collectively\u00a0willing to assist and support a woman in such a lucrative, personal endeavor.<br /> <br /> Phoebe Franklin received her Homestead patent # 5937 for 42.23 acres of land on April 11,1896. By that time, she had already cultivated four additional acres of land (up to 10 acres). Acquiring this land felt unprecedented for an African-American woman in the deep south to be afforded such an opportunity.\u00a0\u00a0Researching maps of Phoebe's homestead it appears as if this land was once the very property of her former enslaver, William J. Minor and the Waterloo Plantation where she was enslaved.\u00a0This could explain how the land was accessible to her for cultivation. A respected elder historian at William Minor\u2019s Southdown Plantation in Houma, Louisiana, stated that Minor would grant his slaves specific areas on his land (at his various plantations) to produce their own crops.<br /> <br /> Phoebe Franklin sold over 10 acres soon after acquiring her land.

The years, occupation, and residential neighborhood seem to line up. The Thompson Baxter who died \"at South Boston,\" worked as a \"bookkeeper,\" and would have been in his mid-thirties when the Vigilance Committee formed.

Perhaps Baxter's religious beliefs inspired him to join the Vigilance Committee? He also participated in several fraternal organizations including the Bethesda Lodge 30, Independent Order of Odd Fellows.<sup>3</sup></p> <p>Given the similar profession and neighborhood, it is likely that the Thompson Baxter who died in 1900 is the same who served in the Vigilance Committee, though we do not know for certain.

She had a shrewd sense of humor and an innovative perspective on women. Her drawings changed the course of one of the most important civil rights movements in the history of the United States.<br /> <br /> Born Nina Evans in Auburn, Kansas in 1872, Allender spent her early years in Washington, D.C. studying painting at the Corcoran School of Art and the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. In early 1913, Allender received a visit from <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/alice-paul.htm\">Alice Paul</a>, founder of the Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage and the National Woman's Party, asking her to contribute money and time to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/introducing-the-19th-amendment.htm\">suffrage</a> cause.\u00a0<br /> <br /> From 1914 until her final cartoon appeared in 1927, Nina Allender contributed over 150 <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/bepa/learn/photosmultimedia/index.htm\">cartoons to the woman suffrage campaign</a>. The drawings were primarily created for\u00a0<em>The Suffragist</em>, the weekly publication of the Congressional Union and National Woman's Party from 1913 until 1921, and later it successor\u00a0<em>Equal Rights,\u00a0</em>published from 1923 until 1954. The National Woman's Party was the only suffrage organization with an \"official cartoonist.\"<br /> <br /> Allender's work altered public opinion. Her drawings presented the suffragists as political, powerful, and in control--an innovative approach to drawing women. Women were shown with their hands on their hips, standing proudly above the crowd, unafraid of the repercussions of their new public persona. As the NWP began the strategy in 1917 of picketing the White House, Allender's cartoons depicted the demonstrators as elegant, reasonable, and ladylike to counter critics who accused the women of being transgressive and treasonous. When picketers faced violence from angry mobs, Allender's cartoons showed the women steadfastly holding their banners high while being attacked. Allender's cartoons reflected the new spirit of the suffrage movement, with women who demanded the vote first and now. These were women who would not back down from their end goal: a constitutional amendment ensuring that the right to vote could not be denied or abridged based on sex. Her cartoons were visual headlines that captured the news of the week and the spirit of the cause.<br /> <br /> But Nina Allender's work also perpetuated harmful myths about the suffrage movement. The Allender Girl she drew was young, white, and privileged. Working-class women are depicted as the \"inspiration of the suffrage workers,\" but women who <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/the-necessity-of-other-social-movements-to-the-struggle-for-woman-suffrage.htm\">fought for their rights </a>in the workplace were important drivers of the fight for the vote, not just the beneficiaries. Even more significant is the complete erasure of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/african-american-women-and-the-nineteenth-amendment.htm\">Black</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/marie-louise-bottineau-baldwin.htm\">Indigenous</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/nina-otero-warren.htm\">Latina</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/mabel-lee.htm\">Asian</a> and other women of color in the suffrage movement. In Nina Allender's cartoons, all the suffragists are white.<br /> <br /> In addition to cartooning, Nina Allender participated in field campaigns to win support for woman suffrage. After the passage of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/the-nineteenth-amendment.htm\">Nineteenth Amendment</a>, she remained an active member of the National Woman's Party, working for passage of the Equal Rights Amendment.\u00a0<br /> <br /> Allender is considered one of the most significant political artists of the woman suffrage era, capturing the spirited struggle for women\u2019s rights as it happened and providing a unique window into this intense chapter in women\u2019s history. Allender gave the majority of the cartoons she drew during this time to the National Woman\u2019s Party. But for decades, her original works were tucked away in a closet in an unlabeled box. They were discovered in 2001 and were displayed in the museum of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/bepa/learn/history-of-the-house.htm\">Sewall-Belmont House</a>, which became the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/bepa/index.htm\">Belmont-Paul Women's Equality National Monument</a> in 2016.

Her distinctive wire sculpture became internationally famous.</p> <hr /> <p paraeid=\"{bffa396d-f913-4120-b6b7-ba27d87c940f}{20}\" paraid=\"568969311\"><em><strong>What challenges have you overcome in your life?

Her parents\u00a0immigrated\u00a0from Japan\u00a0before her\u00a0birth\u00a0and worked as farmers.\u00a0Due to discriminatory laws, her parents were unable to apply for US citizenship.\u00a0The fourth of seven children,\u00a0Asawa\u00a0helped her parents grow, harvest, and sell produce.<br /> <br /> Asawa\u2019s\u00a0life was uprooted after Japan\u00a0bombed\u00a0the American Naval Base in\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/perl/index.htm\">Pearl Harbor</a>, Hawai\u2019i\u00a0in\u00a0December\u00a01941.\u00a0In response, the\u00a0US government\u00a0declared war on Japan\u00a0and officially entered World War II. Fearing\u00a0that people of Japanese descent would sympathize with Japan, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt issued Executive Order\u00a09066. An executive order\u00a0is a rule or law that can only be issued by a sitting president. Executive Order 9066\u00a0forced all Japanese and Japanese\u00a0Americans\u00a0in the US to relocate to\u00a0internment\u00a0camps.\u00a0Even though people like\u00a0Asawa\u00a0and her siblings were American citizens, the government forcibly\u00a0detained them for the duration of the war.\u00a0<br /> <br /> In February of 1942, law enforcement\u00a0arrested\u00a0Asawa\u2019s\u00a0father\u00a0and imprisoned him in\u00a0a\u00a0labor camp\u00a0in New Mexico.\u00a0He remained separated from his family until 1948. Only a few months after her father was arrested, Ruth and her family were forced to leave\u00a0their\u00a0farm\u00a0and all of their belongings. They spent the next six months at the\u00a0Santa Anita\u00a0racetrack\u00a0in Los Angeles\u00a0living in a smelly horse stable.\u00a0In late 1942, the\u00a0Asawa\u00a0family\u00a0was forcibly\u00a0taken\u00a0to\u00a0Rohwer\u00a0War Relocation Center in Arkansas.\u00a0Significant for its association with World War II and the incarceration\u00a0process,\u00a0Rohwer\u00a0was designated a National Historic Landmark\u00a0in 1992.

While incarcerated,\u00a0she attended high school\u00a0in the camp\u00a0and\u00a0studied\u00a0art.\u00a0She even\u00a0volunteered as the art editor for the school yearbook.\u00a0\u00a0<br /> <br /> Shortly after\u00a0the US government released her family from\u00a0Rohwer\u00a0in 1945,\u00a0Asawa\u00a0enrolled in\u00a0art school\u00a0at Black Mountain College in North Carolina.\u00a0Founded in 1933, the experimental\u00a0school\u00a0was internationally known for\u00a0its\u00a0modernist advancements in American art and education.\u00a0Today, the Black Mountain College\u00a0Historic District\u00a0is listed in the National Register of Historic Places for its association with famous artists like\u00a0Asawa.\u00a0Even though schools in the South were still segregated, the college welcomed\u00a0women and people of color\u00a0and offered opportunities for students\u00a0to learn and express their creativity.\u00a0Asawa\u00a0spent three years\u00a0at Black\u00a0Mountain\u00a0College\u00a0where she\u00a0met her future husband, architect\u00a0Albert Lanier.\u00a0\u00a0<br /> <br /> Asawa\u00a0and Lanier married and moved to San Francisco where they had six children.\u00a0Asawa\u00a0had little free time to create her art and often spent late evenings in her home studio. She developed her own style\u00a0creating\u00a0sculptures\u00a0with industrial wire.\u00a0Experimenting with different forms,\u00a0Asawa\u00a0challenged popular expectations of what defined a \u201csculpture\u201d by twisting and molding\u00a0the\u00a0wire.\u00a0Her work\u00a0was\u00a0eventually displayed in galleries in San\u00a0Francisco\u00a0and New York City.\u00a0\u00a0<br /> <br /> In addition to becoming an internationally famous artist, Asawa also\u00a0advocated for art education.

Policymakers used the ideas of Grant and those who agreed with him to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/closing-the-door-on-immigration.htm\">restrict immigration</a> and to control people\u2019s ability to have children. Any history of the National Park Service is incomplete without an accounting of Madison Grant\u2019s influence.</p> <hr /> <h4>Conservation & National Park System</h4> <p>Madison Grant was born in New York in 1865 into wealth and privilege. He became a passionate sportsman, frequently taking fishing and hunting trips. In the late 1800s, many sportsmen\u2014most of whom were wealthy, white men\u2014worried about dwindling game numbers. They believed laws were necessary to curb over-hunting. Grant was an early member of\u00a0the Boone and Crockett Club in New York and pushed for conservation laws alongside fellow hunters like <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thro/learn/historyculture/theodore-roosevelt.htm\">Theodore Roosevelt</a>. Their lobbying led to protections for the endangered bison of Oklahoma\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.fws.gov/refuge/wichita_mountains/\">Wichita Mountains</a>. This area became one of the\u00a0country\u2019s first national wildlife refuges.<br /> <br /> Grant was also central to expanding the national park system. He and other conservationists advocated for the area now known as <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/glac/index.htm\">Glacier National Park</a> in Montana to be protected. Elsewhere, Grant assisted with legally protecting the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/ever/index.htm\">Everglades</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/dena/index.htm\">Denali</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/olym/index.htm\">Olympic</a> National Parks. He also led the Save the Redwoods League to protect California sequoia trees.<br /> <br /> Grant and his colleagues were successful in advocating for many laws to protect lands across the US, from <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/state/ak/index.htm\">Alaska</a> to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/adirondacks-introduction.htm\">Adirondacks</a> of New York. Animal populations began to bounce back. But conservationists often disregarded the human consequences of these projects. Conservation laws hurt many subsistence hunters who depended on hunting for food and income. In establishing national parks, state and federal governments assumed they were the rightful stewards of this land, regardless of the ancestral claims of Indigenous people.<br /> <br /> Grant was successful because of his important connections and privilege as an affluent white male in American society.\u00a0Politicians and social elites supported Grant\u2019s environmental protection work. Grant fought for wealthy, white Americans to enjoy nature. He convinced his allies by using language that described a \u201cpure\u201d and \u201cpristine\u201d America.<br /> <br /> This language of purity also appeared in debates about immigration and eugenics that raged in the early twentieth century.\u00a0In Madison Grant\u2019s case, these images were connected.\u00a0He argued that both white Americans and \u201cpure\u201d nature needed to be protected from \u201cinvasive,\u201d non-native species.</p> <h4><b>What is Eugenics?</b></h4> <p>Literally meaning \u201cto be well born,\u201d eugenics is the belief that a society should improve itself by controlling people\u2019s reproduction. Eugenicists believed that some groups of people should be prevented from having children. Madison Grant was among those who invented elaborate systems for classifying people based on their real or perceived disabilities. Further, Grant and other eugenicists argued that certain racial groups were superior to others. Today, we call\u00a0these theories \u201cscientific racism.\u201d They use the language of science but have no basis in evidence.</p> <hr /> <p><a id=\"http://www.eugenicsarchive.org/eugenics/view_image.pl?id=1565\" onmouseover=\"return window.status='http://www.eugenicsarchive.org/eugenics/view_image.pl?id=1565'\"></a><a onmouseover=\"return window.status='http://www.eugenicsarchive.org/eugenics/view_image.pl?id=1565'\"><img alt=\"American Eugenics Society Exhibit at Philadelphia Sesquicentennial Exhibition, 1926\" id=\"http://www.eugenicsarchive.org/eugenics/view_image.pl?id=1565||CPIMAGE:7124177|0|\" src=\"/people/images/american-eugenics-society-exhibit.jpg\" style=\"margin-top:5px;margin-bottom:5px;margin-left:9px;margin-right:9px;\" title=\"American Eugenics Society Exhibit at Philadelphia Sesquicentennial Exhibition, 1926\" /></a><br /> <i>An exhibit of the American Eugenics Society at the Sesquicentennial Exposition in Philadelphia, 1926. Courtesy of the American Philosophical Society.</i></p> <hr /> <p>These ideas emerged out of Charles Darwin\u2019s 19<sup>th</sup>-century findings on evolution. Social theorists, like Darwin\u2019s cousin Francis Galton, twisted these theories of evolution and applied them to human beings. Known as \u201cSocial Darwinism,\u201d this concept asserted that certain groups were more \u201cfit\u201d to survive than others. People like Galton\u2014and later,\u00a0Madison Grant\u2014used this concept to justify imperialism and colonization. Galton expanded on the idea of Social Darwinism, coining the term \u201ceugenics\u201d in the 1880s.<br /> <br /> Social Darwinism, scientific racism, and eugenics were widespread in the early 1900s.\u00a0These ideas caused untold harm to vulnerable people. Eugenics policies targeted people with disabilities, those who were incarcerated, people of color, and poor communities. Many well-educated and powerful people and institutions supported them. But other prominent voices criticized these ideas and policies. The anthropologist Franz Boas, for example, spoke out against eugenics. He worked to show what scientists now accept: that race is a social construction, not a biological reality.</p> <h4><b><i>The Passing of the Great Race</i></b></h4> <p>Madison Grant\u2019s influential book <i>The Passing of the Great Race</i> (1916) advanced his racist ideas. Grant claimed that people from Northern Europe were at the top of a natu<img alt=\"Title Page of The Passing of the Great Race\" id=\"||CPIMAGE:7121677|0|\" src=\"/people/images/passing-of-the-great-race.jpg\" style=\"width:40%;float:right;\" title=\"Title Page of The Passing of the Great Race\" />ral racial hierarchy. He called white people from Nothern and Western Europe \"Nordics\" and asserted that they had\u00a0evolved in a harsh climate that had made them physically and intellectually superior. Although Grant used scientific language, his theories were not based on\u00a0evidence.<br /> <br /> Grant alleged that this supposed \"Nordic race\" was in danger of going extinct. He claimed, without evidence, that immigration and racial intermarriage caused crime and political corruption. According to Grant's racist hierarchy, any mixing between \"Nordics\" and the other groups he saw as inferior could not be tolerated. He believed it would doom the United States.</p> <h4><b>Eugenics and Immigration Restriction</b></h4> <p>To solve this imagined \"problem,\" Grant advocated for eugenics policies and immigration restriction. He supported forced sterilization, the surgical process of removing a person\u2019s capacity to reproduce. He first focused on people with disabilities and those who had committed crimes. He suggested that \u201cworthless race types\u201d should also be sterilized. In\u00a0<em>The Passing of the Great Race,\u00a0</em>he wrote:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"A rigid system of selection through the elimination of those who are weak or unfit\u2014in other words social failures\u2014would solve the whole question in one hundred years, as well as enable us to get rid of the undesirables who crowd our jails, hospitals, and insane asylums. The individual himself can be nourished, educated and protected by the community during his lifetime, but the state through sterilization must see to it that his line stops with him.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>In the United States, state governments passed eugenics laws that resulted in thousands of people being permanently placed in institutions. These laws also authorized the sterilization of tens of thousands of people. Many of them were poor people of color.<br /> <br /> Grant also advocated for immigration restrictions. He was vice president of the Immigration Restriction League and lobbied for the Immigration Act of 1924, which <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/closing-the-door-on-immigration.htm\">sharply reduced the number of immigrants</a> allowed into the country and set quotas based on national origin. These quotas had their roots in wrongheaded scientific racism, including\u00a0statistics provided by Grant.</p> <hr /> <p><a id=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/cph.3a44285/\" onmouseover=\"return window.status='https://www.loc.gov/resource/cph.3a44285/'\"><img alt=\"Anti-Immigration Cartoon, 1921\" id=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/cph.3a44285/||CPIMAGE:7121708|0|\" src=\"/people/images/quota-cartoon_1.jpg\" style=\"margin-top:7px;margin-bottom:7px;margin-left:9px;margin-right:9px;\" title=\"Anti-Immigration Cartoon, 1921\" /></a><br /> <br /> <em>This 1921 cartoon\u00a0advocates for an immigration quota\u00a0system, depicting a funnel with the large end labeled \"Europe\" and the small end opening into \"U.S.A.\" and labeled \"3%.\" <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/cph.3a44285/\">Courtesy Library of Congress</a>.</em></p> <hr /> <p>Madison Grant was not alone in his beliefs about eugenics and hierarchy of races. He shared these ideas with other people who supported conservation and other social reforms. President <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thro/index.htm\">Theodore Roosevelt</a>, for example, supported sterilization of incarcerated individuals and people with cognitive disabilities. Margaret Sanger, an advocate of birth control, expressed similar views about Black Americans and people she deemed \u201cdefective.\u201d\u00a0While we often celebrate these Americans for their contributions to social progress,\u00a0we must also remember their troubling legacies.</p> <h4><b>Death and Legacy</b></h4> <p>Grant never married and had no children. He died at the age of 71 from kidney disease. In his will, he left thousands of dollars to the New York Zoological Society, the American Museum of Natural History, and the Boone and Crockett Club. While his work as a eugenicist had been popular in the 1920s, it fell out of favor by the 1950s. His ideas became further discredited when it became public that Adolf Hitler and the Nazis found inspiration in Grant\u2019s work, as historian Jonathan Spiro writes. In 2021, <a href=\"http://www.parks.ca.gov/NewsRelease/1024\">California State Parks removed a\u00a0marker\u00a0honoring Grant</a> from Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park.<br /> \u00a0</p> <hr /> <h4>Bibliography</h4> <p>Spiro, Jonathan. <i>Conservation, Eugenics, and the Legacy of Madison Grant</i>.

Along with their 13 colonies along the Atlantic Ocean, Great Britain also laid claim to the land west of the Appalachian Mountains, north of the Ohio River and east of the Mississippi River. However, Hamilton was only given around 300 soldiers to maintain order on the western frontier. Like any good military mind, Hamilton knew he had to find some way to keep the land-hungry American settlers out of the Northwest.</p> <p>Thus, he armed local Native American\u00a0tribes north of the Ohio River and sent them on devastating raids into Kentucky, which was now a county of Virginia. Though known as a \"Hairbuyer\" by George Rogers Clark and others, there is no evidence that Hamilton awarded the natives with presents if they brought American scalps back to Fort Detroit. These brutal attacks took place throughout 1777, leading the settlers of Kentucky to call it the year of the bloody sevens.</p> <p>The fighting on the frontier during the American Revolution was vastly different than the fighting in the east. Instead of decisive battles featuring hundreds or thousands of men fighting in open warfare, fighting on the frontier was done mainly through raids by both sides.</p> <p>These\u00a0raids caused Lt. Colonel George Rogers Clark of the Virginia militia to call for an attack on the British outposts of Kaskaskia, Cahokia, and Vincennes. Clark hoped by taking these posts and eventually capturing Fort Detroit, he could better protect American settlers in Kentucky. After Clark's daring campaign captured the outposts, Hamilton called for a counterattack with 500 British regulars, French militia, and Native American tribes to march from Fort Detroit and retake Vincennes and the fort that had been constructed there, Fort Sackville. Hamilton captured the fort on December 18, 1778. Hamilton ordered the French townspeople to take a new oath of allegiance to the British crown.</p> <p>Hamilton's actions led to a daring counterattack by George Rogers Clark which led to the recapture of the fort by Clark and his combined forces of American militia and French volunteers on February 25, 1779.</p> <p>As the Americans lay seige to the fort, it was clear to Hamilton that he could no longer hold the post and on the morning of February 25th, he did not raise the British flag over the fort because he wanted to be spared the humiliation of taking it down in front of his enemies. Hamilton was eventually put in chains and sent back to Williamsburg, Virginia as a prisoner.</p> <p>Hamilton was eventually exchanged and became the the Lieutenant Governor and later Deputy Governor of Quebec, before spending his remaining years as governor of Bermuda and Antigua in the Caribbean. Hamilton was also a talented sketch artist and was known for his sketches of Indian tribes that he came into contact with on the frontier.</p> <p>Hamilton's legacy today remains mixed. He will always be known as the man who surrendered Fort Sackville to George Rogers Clark, but modern historians have taken a different view of his life. Hamilton kept a journal throughout the entirety of his march on Vincennes, his time at Fort Sackville, and his journey to Williamsburg as a prisoner. It provides the other side of the story. This journal offers invaluable information as we attempt to study this man known as \"the Hairbuyer General.\" Hamilton's journal is available thanks to the Indiana Historical Bureau.\u00a0</p>", "geometryPoiId": "", "firstName": "Henry", "middleName": "", "lastName": "Hamilton", "quickFacts": [{"id": "F7A67C96-173F-4675-B374-7E3D3A1818B2", "value": "Revolutionary War", "name": "Significance"}, {"id": "7F812988-263D-4233-81CF-6E7A89621004", "value": "Dublin, Ireland", "name": "Place of Birth"}, {"id": "5E9CA71F-E57B-4222-BBD3-1A225E2351C2", "value": "1734", "name": "Date of Birth"}, {"id": "3905576C-509A-49F5-A8EE-B4CF14529BBB", "value": "Antigua", "name": "Place of Death"}, {"id": "8F2D2A55-2E87-4DF3-8E09-8520B5A5B7FD", "value": "1796", "name": "Date of Death"}], "credit": ""}

Ting\u2019s experiences as a foreign student studying in the US illustrate the influence of American medical education <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/tellingallamericansstories/roleofunited-states.htm\">around the world</a>.\u00a0</p> <hr /> <p><em><strong>Describe a time you have made a decision that changed the course of your life.</strong></em></p> <hr /> <h4>Early Life and Education</h4> <p>In 1891, Ting was born in Shanghai, China. Her father Gan-Ren Ting was a well-known doctor and practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine. Although her parents and grandfather had arranged for her to be married, Ting followed in her father\u2019s footsteps and became a doctor. After she graduated from McTyeire High School for Girls, a missionary school in Shanghai, she left home to prepare for medical school. Ting traveled to Nanjing to work with Dr. Li Yuin Tsao, a fellow graduate of McTyeire High School. After working as Tsao\u2019s assistant for about a year, Ting departed for the United States to continue her education.\u00a0<br /> <br /> From 1892 until 1943, the United States government severely limited the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/aapi-theme-study-essay-4-immigration.htm\">immigration</a> of Chinese laborers and prohibited Chinese immigrants from becoming US citizens. As a student, Me-Iung Ting was able to come to the US on a Boxer Indemnity Scholarship.[1] With hopes of reforming the medical care that women and children received in China, Ting benefited from the standardization of American medical training during the early 1900s.<br /> <br /> In 1914, Ting began preparing for medical school at Mt. Holyoke College in Massachusetts. She pursued her doctorate at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbour.[2] When Ting arrived in 1916, she was the only Chinese woman studying there. While in Michigan, Ting began to become more interested in global public health.\u00a0</p> <h4>Medical Career</h4> <p>In 1919, Ting attended the International Conference of Women Physicians held at the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) Headquarters in New York City. Ting viewed her American education and participation in the conference as ways to support China\u2019s future. She believed that if she and other Chinese women became educated and worked in medicine, they could bring about the conference\u2019s goals: better public health, equal suffrage, and permanent peace.<br /> <br /> After Ting graduated as a medical doctor in 1920, she interned at the Detroit Woman\u2019s Hospital and Infant\u2019s Home to study obstetrics. To gain experience with infectious diseases, she completed additional internships at a woman\u2019s hospital in Philadelphia and at the Willard Parker Hospital in New York City. After eight years of study in the United States, Ting eagerly returned to China in April 1922.</p> <h4>Return to China</h4> <p>During the summer of 1922, Ting reunited with her mentor Dr. Li Yuin Tsao at the Tientsin (Peiyang) Women\u2019s Hospital in northeastern China. By August, Tsao unexpectedly fell ill and died, leaving Ting to assume her mentor\u2019s responsibilities and become the hospital\u2019s director. Although she longed to return home to Shanghai, Ting realized there was a greater need for her services in Tientsin. Ting served as the director of the Tientsin Women\u2019s Hospital for twenty years.\u00a0<br /> <br /> Because of her work supporting women\u2019s health, Ting led the Chinese delegation to the first Pan-Pacific Women\u2019s Congress. The conference was held at the Punahou School in Honolulu in August 1928.[3] American settlement house movement pioneer <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/jane-addams.htm\">Jane Addams</a> served as the honorary chairperson of the Congress.\u00a0<br /> <br /> That year, the University of Michigan awarded Ting a year-long Barbour Fellowship, an endowed scholarship for female graduate students from Asia and the Middle East. From September 1929 through October 1930, Ting returned to Michigan to research and write a book on prenatal care.\u00a0<br /> <br /> In 1935, Tientsin\u2019s mayor appointed Ting the director of the Tientsin Infants Asylum, which cared for orphaned girls. Ting was the first woman appointed to a government position in this Chinese city. Around this time, Ting also adopted two of her nieces, who she encouraged to study in the United States and become doctors.\u00a0<br /> <br /> During the second Sino-Japanese War, Ting resisted restrictions imposed by Japanese authorities so she could help women deliver babies safely. During the 1931-1932 Japanese invasion of Manchuria, she assisted thousands of Korean refugees and offered them medical care in hospitals and camps. For a period of eighteen days in January 1939, Japanese authorities imprisoned Ting. The alumni association at the University of Michigan petitioned her release. Although the Japanese government gave no justification for the arrest, one of Ting\u2019s relatives claimed it was because Ting insisted on flying an American flag from her car during the Japanese occupation.\u00a0<br /> <br /> During the 1940s, Ting continued to support international peace and relief efforts as a civil war broke out in China between the Nationalists and Communists. She served as the chair of China\u2019s International Relief Committee from 1943 until 1949 and later chaired the United Nations Emergency Fund for Children, which is now known as UNICEF. The unrest eventually culminated with the establishment of the People\u2019s Republic of China and the Communist government under Chairman Mao Zedong.<br /> <br /> Ting eventually decided to flee China. Using a special travel permit, she passed through Hong Kong and England before immigrating to the United States in 1950. To continue working as a doctor in the US, Ting allegedly decreased her age by ten years. Ting continued to practice medicine for the rest of her life and publicly spoke out against China\u2019s Communist government. She taught pre-nursing at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/mississippi-tougaloo-college.htm\">Tougaloo College</a> in Mississippi, and worked at a women\u2019s prison in Connecticut and a school in Massachusetts.[4] Ting became a US citizen in 1969. On July 15, 1969, while attending a medical conference in New York City, she died of a heart attack.<br /> \u00a0</p> <h4><strong>Notes</strong></h4> <p>[1] The Boxer Rebellion of 1900 opposed the presence of foreigners, colonizers, and Christian missionaries in China. When an international coalition put down the rebellion, the members of the coalition required China to pay reparations. To support its economic and political interests, the U.S. government agreed to allow China to pay off some of the reparations as Boxer Indemnity scholarships. These scholarships allowed Chinese students to study at American colleges.\u00a0<br /> [2] The University of Michigan Central Campus Historic District was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.<br /> [3] The Punahou School Campus was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.<br /> [4] Tougaloo College was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.</p> <h4>Bibliography</h4> <p>Barry, Sara and Grow, Jennifer. \u201c<a href=\"https://issuu.com/mhcalumnae/docs/mhqspr15_issuu\">To Boldly Go</a>.\u201d <em>Mount Holyoke Alumnae Quarterly</em> 99, no. 2 (Spring 2015): 28-33.<br /> Albino, Donna. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.mtholyoke.edu/~dalbino/letters/women/mting.html\">Me-Iung Ting x1916</a>.\u201d A Postcard Collection of Mount Holyoke College.

Her embrace of protest and direct action in the early 1900s marked a new phase in the battle for women\u2019s votes.<br /> <br /> Fourteen-year-old Emmeline Goulden attended a public meeting about women\u2019s rights in Manchester, England in the early 1870s. By the time she left it, she had become \u201ca conscious and confirmed suffragist.\u201d This work continued throughout her life. She and her husband Richard Pankhurst, a strong supporter of women\u2019s rights, were active in early British suffrage groups. They pushed not only for the vote but also for equality for women in divorce and inheritance law.<br /> <br /> By the early 20th century, Pankhurst had become frustrated with British political parties\u2019 inaction on suffrage. She founded the Women\u2019s Social and Political Union (WSPU) in 1903 to take militant action. The group targeted any political party that did not work towards votes for women.<br /> <br /> The WSPU\u2019s motto was \u201cdeeds, not words.\u201d Pankhurst and her supporters attracted attention through their confrontational actions. They got themselves arrested and imprisoned for civil disobedience. In prison, several of them went on hunger strikes and endured brutal force-feedings. Others interrupted cabinet meetings and heckled politicians. Some activists even set fires in mailboxes and vacant houses. \u00a0<br /> <br /> Pankhurst and the WSPU had a significant influence on the American suffrage movement. While in graduate school in England, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/alice-paul.htm\">Alice Paul</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/lucy-burns.htm\">Lucy Burns</a>\u00a0met Emmeline Pankhurst and her daughters, Christabel and Sylvia. The pageantry of WSPU marches\u2014the banners, trumpets, coordinated chants, and military-style march organization\u2014inspired them. Paul and Burns began attending English suffrage demonstrations and were arrested several times in 1909.<br /> <br /> Paul and Burns brought these ideas and tactics home to the United States, organizing the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/woman-suffrage-procession1913.htm\">1913 Woman Suffrage Procession</a> and the \"<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/national-womans-party-protests-world-war-i.htm\">Silent Sentinels</a>\"\u00a0pickets outside the White House. They also borrowed the English strategy of a single-issue focus on winning suffrage. The organization they founded, the Congressional Union (later the National Woman\u2019s Party), pushed for a constitutional amendment.<br /> <br /> Emmeline Pankhurst also influenced the American suffrage movement through speaking tours. In 1909, Harriot Stanton Blatch (a suffragist and the daughter of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/elizabeth-cady-stanton.htm\">Elizabeth Cady Stanton</a>)\u00a0sponsored her tour through the Northeast, where she spoke in Boston, New York City, and Geneva, New York.[1] She returned in 1913. During a stop in Hartford, Connecticut, she delivered perhaps her most famous speech, \u201cFreedom or Death.\u201d Pankhurst defended the British suffragettes\u2019 militancy. She argued that it was the only option for forcing the government to recognize women\u2019s rights.<br /> <br /> \u201cYou won your freedom in America when you had the revolution, by bloodshed, by sacrificing human life,\u201d she reminded her audience. \u201cYou have left it to women in your land, the men of all civilized countries have left it to women, to work out their own salvation. That is the way in which we women of England are doing. Human life for us is sacred, but we say if any life is to be sacrificed it shall be ours; we won't do it ourselves, but we will put the enemy in the position where they will have to choose between giving us freedom or giving us death.\u201d<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/suffragistvssuffragette.htm\">Suffragettes</a> won a partial victory in 1918 when the United Kingdom granted propertied women over thirty the right to vote. Pankhurst continued to work for women\u2019s empowerment, though her politics grew less radical. She committed herself to anti-communism, defended British imperialism, and became a member of the Conservative Party late in life. Despite ill health, Pankhurst lived to see suffrage extended to women on the same terms as men in England, Wales, and Scotland in 1928. She died that year at the age of 69.</p> <h4>Notes</h4> <p>[1] Pankhurst spoke at several historic venues during her speaking tours in the United States. In 1909, she spoke at Carnegie Hall in New York City (NRHP, October 15, 1966; NHL, December 29, 1962) and at the Smith Opera House in Geneva, NY (NRHP, October 10, 1979).<br /> \u00a0</p> <h4>Bibliography</h4> <p><br /> Bartley, Paula.\u00a0<em>Emmeline Pankhurst.\u00a0</em>London: Routledge, 2002.\u00a0<a href=\"https://awpc.cattcenter.iastate.edu/2017/03/09/freedom-or-death-part-1-nov-13-1913/\">https://awpc.cattcenter.iastate.edu/2017/03/09/freedom-or-death-part-1-nov-13-1913/</a>.<br /> Pankhurst, Emmeline. \"Freedom or Death,\" 1913.\u00a0<br /> Pankhurst, Emmeline.\u00a0<em>My Own Story,\u00a0</em>1914.<br /> Philpott, Susan. \"Suffragette & Suffragist: The Influence of the British Suffrage Movement.\" The Suff Buffs Blog.\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.womensvote100.org/the-suff-buffs-blog/2020/5/20/suffragette-suffragist-influence-of-british-suffrage-movement\">https://www.womensvote100.org/the-suff-buffs-blog/2020/5/20/suffragette-suffragist-influence-of-british-suffrage-movement</a><br /> Purvis, June.\u00a0<em>Emmeline Pankhurst: A Biography</em>.

During these meetings, Read would provide Roosevelt a marked-up copy of the Congressional Record\u00a0and together they discussed possible league activities.</p> <p>Later in 1921, the three women became close friends, meeting several evenings a week in <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/greenwich-village-historic-district.htm\">Greenwich Village</a> as part of the New Women movement, which focused on political power and economic change. In 1923, working with Roosevelt, Lape administered the competition for the\u00a0Bok Peace Prize. From this work, Lape published twenty of the most interesting proposals from the competition and wrote an introductory analysis. Lape's analysis received great praise. However, in January 1924, the Senate began investigating charges that the Bok Peace Prize was the tool of \"foreign governments or foreign institutions.\" Lape testified before the Senate and identified Roosevelt and Narcissa Vanderlip\u00a0as two of the most influential members of the selection committee. The hearings were suspended because of President\u00a0Wilson's death and never brought up again. Throughout the 1920s, Lape continued to work in international affairs, in particular in support of U.S. participation in the\u00a0World Court.</p> <p>During the 1930s, Lape and Roosevelt conferred regularly on political issues, including U.S. recognition of the Soviet Union and the failure of the 1935 Social Security Act to address health care. World War II\u00a0pulled health care issues away from the forefront of both the administration and the Congress. Yet, Lape continued her crusade for better health care and in 1955 wrote\u00a0<em>Medical Research: A Midcentury Survey</em>. This work was sponsored by the American Foundation, when Roosevelt was a board member.</p> <p>Together, Read, Lape, and Roosevelt would remain not only dedicated to political issues but stalwart friends, as well. As first lady, Roosevelt rented a small apartment in a building owned by Lape and Read in Greenwich Village. Roosevelt used this apartment to escape the pressures of her public position and in order to spend time with her friends. Lape and Read also owned a country home in Westbrook, Connecticut, known as Salt Meadow (today part of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service). Roosevelt also spent time there as well, often writing her \"My Day\" column.</p> <p>After Read's death in 1943, Roosevelt remained friends with Lape and visited her often up until Roosevelt's own death in 1962. In 1965 Lape, along with others, asked the Nobel Committee to consider posthumously awarding Eleanor Roosevelt the Peace Prize. However, the prize that year went to UNICEF. In her later years, Lape served as a source of information for Joseph Lash's biographies on Roosevelt. Lape died on May 17, 1981 in New York City.</p> <p><em>Article courtesy of the Eleanor Roosevelt Papers Project, George Washington University.</em></p>", "geometryPoiId": "", "firstName": "Esther", "middleName": "Everett", "lastName": "Lape", "quickFacts": [{"id": "F7A67C96-173F-4675-B374-7E3D3A1818B2", "value": "American Journalist", "name": "Significance"}, {"id": "7F812988-263D-4233-81CF-6E7A89621004", "value": "Wilmington, DE", "name": "Place of Birth"}, {"id": "5E9CA71F-E57B-4222-BBD3-1A225E2351C2", "value": "October 8, 1881", "name": "Date of Birth"}, {"id": "3905576C-509A-49F5-A8EE-B4CF14529BBB", "value": "New York City", "name": "Place of Death"}, {"id": "8F2D2A55-2E87-4DF3-8E09-8520B5A5B7FD", "value": "May 17, 1981", "name": "Date of Death"}], "credit": ""}

Anthony</a> speak.<sup>2</sup></p> <p>Florence Luscomb attended local Boston schools and became one of the few women admitted to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. While studying there, Luscomb joined its chapter of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/boston-cesl.htm\">College Equal Suffrage League</a>, a women\u2019s suffrage organization. Soon after graduating with a degree in architecture in 1909, Luscomb began her career as a suffragist.<sup>3</sup></p> <p>Along with other young suffragists, Florence Luscomb helped revitalize the movement by bringing the issue of women\u2019s suffrage to the wider public. She attended the first open-air meetings, campaigned in towns throughout the state, and sold <em>The Woman\u2019s Journal</em> on street corners. Luscomb also joined other innovative suffragists in reaching out to local Boston communities of varying class, racial, ethnic, and religious backgrounds. As a result, Florence Luscomb stood out as one of the state\u2019s most popular and effective suffrage speakers.<sup>4</sup></p> <p>While advocating for women\u2019s suffrage in local Black churches, Florence Luscomb opened her eyes to the injustice against African Americans. She joined the Boston chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in its early years of establishment, serving in numerous leadership positions. Recognizing the particular plight of African Americans, Luscomb noted: \u201cDiscrimination against women is bitter, but it is to me nowhere near as terrific an oppression as is discrimination against black people.\u201d<sup>5</sup> Florence Luscomb supported the civil rights movement and collaborated with Boston\u2019s Black leaders throughout the course of her life.</p> <p>In the decades following the ratification of the 19<sup>th</sup> Amendment, Luscomb continued her involvement in politics. In 1920, she began working with the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/boston-league-of-women-voters.htm\">Boston League of Women Voters</a>, which supported her run for Boston City Council in 1922. Luscomb later ran as a third party candidate in several races, including in the 1936 election for Massachusetts 9<sup>th</sup> District in the House of Representative (People\u2019s Labor Party) and in the 1952 race for Massachusetts Governor (Progressive Party).<sup>6</sup></p> <p>During this time, Florence Luscomb broadened her activism beyond the causes of women and African Americans. She joined a variety of civil rights, labor, and peace organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union, the Massachusetts Civic League (a public welfare organization), the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/international-ladies-garment-workers-union.htm\">International Ladies Garment Workers Union</a>, and the Women\u2019s International League for Peace and Freedom.<sup>7</sup></p> <p>Florence Luscomb\u2019s progressive views often clashed against the views of the state and federal government. Historian Sharon Hartman Strom noted that her FBI file contained over 9,000 pages. Luscomb\u2019s defense of Communism gained the most attention. While not a Communist herself, she criticized the Red Scare and became a target during red-baiting schemes. When subpoenaed by the Commission to Investigate Communism in Massachusetts, Luscomb attended but refused to comply.<sup>8</sup> Instead, she gave a statement condemning the Commission for its unconstitutional activity, stating:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\"><em>I will not be an accessory to your subversion. I will not answer compulsory questions by government inquisitors into matters of my conscience and opinions, speech, writings, associations and political views in violation of the constitutional provisions of Article 1 of the United States Bill of Rights...I cannot and will not tear up the Constitution and its guaranteed liberties, won with blood and tears. I cannot and will not be a party with you in destroying American democracy.</em><sup>9</sup></p> <p>Well into her 70s and 80s, Florence Luscomb continued to participate in the peace movement and women\u2019s liberation. Still able to draw a crowd in 1970, Luscomb referenced her early activism in women\u2019s rights during an anti-Vietnam War speech on Boston Common:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\"><em>Almost 70 years ago I began my activities in the movement which today goes by the name of \u2018Women\u2019s Liberation\u2019, but which by whatever name is nothing more nor less than an ultimatum that women shall be acknowledged and treated as full, equal members of the human race. We ask nothing more: we will take nothing less.</em><sup>10</sup></p> <p>After a long and successful life as an activist, Florence Luscomb died at the age of 98 in 1985. Living with a strong moral compass, she always stood firm in her understanding of American patriotism: \u201cTo me, patriotism demands not the losing of one\u2019s eyes to the faults and misdeeds of one\u2019s country, but rather the fighting and ending of them, so making America better.\u201d<sup>11</sup></p> <h2>Footnotes:</h2> <ol> <li>Read about Florence Luscomb\u2019s connections to Lowell, her town of birth, at Lowell National Historical Park\u2019s webpage:\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lowe/learn/historyculture/luscomb.htm\">\"Florence Luscomb.\"</a></li> <li>\u201cSuffragist Florence Luscomb, 98: championed causes for 60 years,\u201d <em>Boston Globe</em>, October 28, 1985; \u201cFeminist Florence Luscomb honored, questions equality,\u201d <em>Boston Herald</em>, February 07, 1977.</li> <li>Sharon Hartman Strom,\u00a0<em>Political Woman: Florence Luscomb and the Legacy of Radical Reform</em>\u00a0(Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 2001).</li> <li>Strom, <em>Political Woman</em>,\u00a074-77.</li> <li>\u201cSuffragist Florence Luscomb, 98: championed causes for 60 years,\u201d <em>Boston Globe</em>, October 28, 1985.</li> <li>\u201cSuffragist Florence Luscomb, 98: championed causes for 60 years,\u201d <em>Boston Globe</em>, October 28, 1985; Strom, <em>Political Woman</em>.</li> <li>\u201cSuffragist Florence Luscomb, 98: championed causes for 60 years,\u201d <em>Boston Globe</em>, October 28, 1985; \u201cFeminist Florence Luscomb honored, questions equality,\u201d <em>Boston Herald</em>, February 07, 1977; Strom, <em>Political Woman</em>.</li> <li>Strom, <em>Political Woman</em>,\u00a0230-239.</li> <li>\"Statement by Miss Florence H.

When she was 4, her father moved to the US to serve as a missionary. Lee remained in Hong Kong and lived with her mother and grandmother. She learned English at a missionary school and won a Boxer Indemnity Scholarship. This academic scholarship granted her a US visa and the Lee family settled in <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/new-york-chinatown-and-little-italy-historic-district.htm\">New York City's\u00a0Chinatown</a> in 1905. Mabel attended <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/erasmus-hall-academy.htm\">Erasmus Hall Academy</a> in Brooklyn.<br /> <br /> By the time she was 16, Mabel Lee was a known figure in New York\u2019s suffrage movement. New York City suffragists held a parade in 1912\u00a0to advocate for women\u2019s voting rights. Ten thousand people attended the parade. Lee, on horseback, helped lead the parade from its starting point in <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/greenwich-village-historic-district.htm\">Greenwich Village</a>. The New York Tribune wrote an article about her before the parade. The article highlighted her academic accomplishments and her desire to improve the lives of women and girls. She was also mentioned in the New York Times\u2019 parade coverage.<br /> <br /> Lee started her studies at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/barnard-hall-at-barnard-college.htm\">Barnard College</a> in New York City in 1912. Barnard College, an all-women\u2019s school, was founded because Columbia University refused to admit women. While there, Mabel joined the Chinese Students\u2019 Association and wrote feminist essays for The Chinese Students\u2019 Monthly. Lee was involved in the suffrage movement throughout college. Her May 1914 essay, \u201cThe Meaning of Woman Suffrage,\u201d argued that suffrage for women was necessary to a successful democracy. The extension of democracy (through voting) and \u201cequality of opportunities to women\u201d was, she stated, the hallmarks of true feminism. In 1915, the Women\u2019s Political Union started a Suffrage Shop and invited Lee to give a speech. Covered by the New York Times, her speech \u201cThe Submerged Half\u201d urged the Chinese community to promote girls\u2019 education and women\u2019s civic participation.<br /> <br /> Women won the right to vote in New York State in 1917. In 1920, the 19th Amendment gave women throughout the country the right to vote. But not all women in the US benefitted. Chinese women, like Mabel Lee, could not vote until 1943. This was because of the Chinese Exclusion Act, a Federal law in place from 1882 to 1943. The Chinese Exclusion Act limited Chinese immigration and prevented Chinese immigrants from becoming citizens. Without US citizenship, Mabel Lee could not vote. Yet, she and other Chinese suffragists advocated for women\u2019s voting rights, even though they did not benefit from the legislation.<br /> <br /> After graduating from Barnard College, Lee got a PhD in economics at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/low-memorial-library.htm\">Columbia University</a>. She was the first Chinese woman to do so. In 1921, Lee published her research as a book called The Economic History of China.<br /> <br /> Ever since high school, Mabel had wanted to move back to China and start a girl\u2019s school. But after her father died in 1924, she took over his role as director of the First Chinese Baptist Church of New York City. She later founded the Chinese Christian Center which served as a community center. It offered vocational and English classes, a health clinic, and a kindergarten. Lee never married and devoted her life to the Chinese community.<br /> <br /> Mabel Lee died in 1966.\u00a0We don\u2019t know if Mabel Lee ever became a US citizen or if she ever voted in the US.<br /> \u00a0</p> <h4>Bibliography</h4> <p>Brooks, Charlotte (2014) \u201cSuffragist Landmark.\u201d <a href=\"https://blogs.baruch.cuny.edu/asianamericanhistorynyc/?p=435\">Asian American History in NYC: Finding the Asian American Past in the Five Boroughs</a>, August 25, 2014.<br /> <br /> Harvard University Library (2018) \u201cChinese Exclusion Act (1882).\u201d <a href=\"http://ocp.hul.harvard.edu/immigration/exclusion.html\">Aspiration, Acculturation, and Impact: Immigration to the United States, 1789-1930</a>, Harvard University Library Open Collection Program.<br /> <br /> Lee, Mabel (1915) \u201c<a href=\"https://timtsengdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/mabel-lee-speech-china_s-submerged.pdf\">China\u2019s Submerged Half</a>.\u201d (.pdf)<br /> <br /> New York Times (1912) \u201cSuffrage Army Out on Parade; Perhaps 10,000 Women and Men Sympathizers March for the Cause.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1912/05/05/archives/suffrage-army-out-on-parade-perhaps-10000-women-and-men.html\">New York Times</a>, May 5, 1912.\u00a0<br /> <br /> New York Tribune (1912) \u201cChinese Girl Wants Vote.\u201d <a href=\"https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1912-04-13/ed-1/seq-3/#date1=1912&index=5&date2=1913&searchType=advanced&language=&sequence=0&lccn=sn83030214&words=LEE+Lee+Mabel+MABEL&proxdistance=5&state=New+York&rows=20&ortext=Mabel&proxtext=&phrasetext=&andtext=Lee&dateFilterType=yearRange&page=1\">New York Tribune</a>, April 13, 1912, p. 3.

Wells</a>, Terrell brought attention to the atrocity of lynching.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">She was also dedicated to racial uplift. Terrell believed that African Americans would be accepted by white society if they received education and job training. She hoped that if black men and women were seen as successful, they would not be discriminated against. She dedicated herself to educating and helping other African Americans. In addition to serving as president of the National Association of Colored Women, Terrell also supported the black woman\u2019s right to vote. She even picketed the White House demanding women\u2019s suffrage.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Terrell also worked to end discriminatory practices of restaurants in Washington, DC. In the early 1870s, DC passed anti-discrimination laws. Places such as restaurants could not turn away customers due to the color of their skin. But by the 1890s, African Americans were once again being banned from public places. Terrell launched a campaign to reinstate anti-discrimination laws. On February 28, 1950, she and several colleagues entered segregated Thompson Restaurant.

In 1847, a slave catcher named Woodfork arrived in Boston to arrest a suspected fugitive on the north slope of Beacon Hill. As many Bostonians deduced, Woodfork sought to recapture Mrs. Dorsey, \u201c\u2026a woman who, by some means, had succeeded in shaking off oppression\u2019s yoke and reaching Boston.\u201d<sup><a href=\"#_ftnref10\">[10]</a></sup></p> <p>In the mid-morning, at a time when all the men were away at work, a commotion arose at the end of Smith Court. A group of young boys reported that a slave-catcher had entered Mrs. Dorsey\u2019s house. Led by Nancy Prince, the women of the neighborhood immediately responded, coming to the rescue of Mrs. Dorsey. Bostonian Thomas B. Hilton recounted the moment:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\"><em>Only for an instant did the fiery eyes of Mrs. Prince rest upon the form of the villain, as if to be fully assured that it was he, for in the next moment she had grappled with him, and before he could fully recognize his position she, with the assistance of the colored women that had accompanied her, had dragged him to the door and thrust him out of the house.</em><sup><a href=\"#_ftnref11\">[11]</a></sup></p> <p>In the moments that followed, the slave-catcher Woodfork made a hasty departure from the scene, aware of his inability to recapture Mrs. Dorsey. Hilton recalled that Woodfork did not return to the north slope of Beacon Hill, nor Boston, for another three years. With little warning and few resources, Nancy Prince and the women from her community successfully protected a woman from recapture and ejected a slavecatcher from the city of Boston.<sup><a href=\"#_ftnref12\">[12]</a></sup></p> <img alt=\"A historic map of Beacon Hill of Boston, with Smith Court. \" data-render=\"0|0|0|1|600|319|0|5|5\" height=\"319\" id=\"||CPIMAGE:6631929|0|\" src=\"/people/images/Smith-Court-map.PNG\" style=\"margin-top:5px;margin-bottom:5px;margin-left:5px;margin-right:5px;\" title=\"Smith Court map\" width=\"600\" /> <p style=\"font-size: .75rem;\"><em>This image of the 1875 Boston Smith map depicts the north slope of Beacon Hill.

Due to these connections, King Kal\u0101kaua and Queen Kapi\u2019olan were present at her wedding to Jack Dowsett in 1888.<br /> <br /> Five short years later, pro-American interests, with the assistance of US Marines, overthrew Queen Lili\u2019uokalani and established the Republic of Hawai\u2019i. The former island nation was annexed to the United States in 1898. With the introduction of this new territory to the Union, the mainland suffragists turned their eyes towards the Pacific to see if any progress could be made.<br /> <br /> Written by <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/susan-b-anthony.htm\">Susan B. Anthony</a> and other officers of the NAWSA, the \u201cHawaiian Appeal\u201d of 1899 asked the US Congress to give Hawaiian women the right to vote \u201cupon whatever conditions and qualifications the right of suffrage is granted to Hawaiian men.\u201d While Anthony and others wanted all women to have voting rights, they were especially concerned about non-Christian Native Hawaiian men gaining that power before the white and Native Hawaiian women of the territory. The Hawaiian Appeal received criticism from almost all corners. Local women, like Dowsett, felt that petitioning the territorial government for greater civil rights was the way to go.<br /> <br /> In 1912, Dowsett founded the National Women\u2019s Equal Suffrage Association of Hawai\u2019i (WESAH), the first Hawaiian suffrage organization. Modeling its constitution on that of the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA), they invited mainland suffragists to speak to the group. One of these women included <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/carrie-chapman-catt.htm\">Carrie Chapman Catt</a> in 1918, who spoke in positive terms about the group after the meeting.\u00a0<br /> <br /> Thanks to the efforts of women like Dowsett and WESAH, President Wilson signed a bill allowing the residents of the territory to decide for themselves. Gathering both Native Hawaiian and white suffragists at the capitol building on the morning of the Senate vote on March 4, 1919, Dowsett declared:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cSister Hawaiians, our foreign sisters are with us. Senator Wise asked us yesterday if the so-called \u2018society women\u2019 were leading us, and we told him that this was not so. We are working all together, and we want the legislature to know this. And we must also remember our Oriental sisters, who are not here today but who will also unite this great cause.\u201d\u2019</p> </blockquote> <p>While many in the territory, like those on the mainland, were against granting the right of suffrage to Asian women, Dowsett included them in her vision of Hawai\u2019i\u2019s future. The bill passed the Hawaiian Senate that day, but a fresh battle was waiting in the House. Instead of granting women\u2019s suffrage immediately, the House decided to put it to a vote of the Hawaiian electorate in 1920. Furious with that response, Dowsett and 500 other women of \u201cvarious nationalities, of all ages\u201d poured onto the House floor with banners demanding \u201cVotes for Women.\u201d Forced to reckon with the demonstrators, the House held hearings the next day for proponents and opponents to make their case. Standing alongside Dowsett were a wide variety of Hawai\u2019ian women including Princess Kalaniana\u2019ole and Lahilahi Webb, former lady-in-waiting to Queen Lili\u2019uokalani\u2019s court.<br /> <br /> A month later, the House had not budged and the suffragists of Hawai\u2019i were losing their patience. Regrouping, Dowsett and her group began to lobby directly to the U.S. Congress through the territorial representative, Prince K\u016bhi\u014d. They also began to create grassroots groups throughout the territory to prepare women for the vote when that opportunity arrived. Hawaiian women became enfranchised along with their mainland sisters when the 19th Amendment became part of the U.S. Constitution in August 1920. As residents of a U.S. territory, however, their elected representation was limited.<br /> <br /> It would take another 39 years for Hawai\u2019i to become the 50th state in the Union, and for the residents of Hawai\u2019i, both male and female, to gain full US voting rights. Dowsett did not live long enough to see that day; she died December 10, 1929. She is buried next to her husband in Oahu Cemetery, Honolulu.<br /> \u00a0</p> <h4>Bibliography</h4> <p>Barker, Joanne.

The 1900 census taker spelled his name\u00a0as \"Anna\u201d. Another element of complexity was in the\u00a0land entry papers which stated that Andrew died in 1876 yet, he appeared\u00a0in the 1880 and 1900 census. In the latter census, he and Sarah were married for twenty-four years.<br /> <br /> Sarah Jane Foster Richardson was born on October 9, 1861 and died on July 9, 1912. She was\u00a0buried in Black Greek AME Cemetery in St. Helena Parish, LA., where Andrew was\u00a0buried.<br /> <br /> Two witnesses testified on behalf of Sarah\u2019s homestead claim: William H. Smith and Benjamin Pierce, stating they had known Sarah Richardson for eight years. They confirmed that Andrew \u201cbuilt an 18x12 feet square house containing four rooms and lived in the house from the 7th day of March 1871 until his death.\" He made the following improvements to the land that included a stable and shed; a vegetable garden; dug a water well and also had a peach and other fruit trees.<br /> <br /> Sarah swore that she was the lawful widow of Andrew Richardson who died on October 10, 1876 at their home in St. Helena Parish. She continued to live there, made improvements and claimed it her home since her husband passed away.<br /> <br /> On August 10, 1878, she appeared for her claim and requested that the final Land Affidavit and Final Homestead Proof submitted be accepted, and was granted the land patent in her name.<br /> <br /> <strong>~ Contributed by Dr. Antoinette Harrell</strong><br /> Dr. Antoinette Harrell is a historian and genealogist who specializes\u00a0in research at\u00a0the Louisiana Florida Parishes.

He lived there with his mother and siblings until about 1785 when the owner\u2019s death forced the estate to be sold up and the slaves sold away. Ball was sold to Jack Cox, a farmer with several slaves, who treated Ball \u201cwith humanity.\u201d But at around age 12 following Cox\u2019s death, Ball was sold again to a much more severe owner who furnished little food or clothing for his slaves, keeping Ball in a constant state of cold and hunger. When he was approximately 20 years old, around 1800, Ball\u2019s master hired him out to the Navy.</p> <p>When Ball arrived at the Washington Navy Yard, he was stationed as a cook aboard the USS <em>Congress. </em>For a hungry young man used to a hard life as a field slave, this hardly seemed like work at all. Ball was eager to please officers, and in turn was gifted with hand-me-down clothing and for the first time in his life some spending money. After nearly two years in the service of the Navy, Ball encountered a novelty \u2013 a free man of color and sailor from Philadelphia. Together, they devised a scheme to smuggle Ball to freedom in the North, but no sooner did they complete their plan than Ball\u2019s former master returned to reclaim him and sell him again, eventually away from his family down to South Carolina.</p> <p>After seven years in slavery in South Carolina, Ball escaped back up to Maryland to be closer to his family. Declaring himself a free man, Ball worked at small farms until war broke out in the Chesapeake. Although Ball could have secured his freedom by joining with the British and being evacuated from the United States, instead he chose to stay and enlist under Commodore Joshua Barney as a free man, attempting to convince other escaped slaves to stay in the United States and fight rather than defect to the British. Ball served as a seaman and a cook in the Chesapeake flotilla, serving at the Battles of St. Leonards Creek and\u00a0Bladensburg. In his\u00a0<a href=\"https://archive.org/details/slaveryinunit00ballcha/page/n4/mode/2up\">1837 memoir</a>, Ball reflected on the Battle of Bladensburg: \u201cI stood at my gun, until the Commodore was shot down\u2026 if the militia regiments, that lay upon our right and left, cold have been brought to charge the British, in close fight, as they crossed the bridge, we should have killed or taken the whole of them in a short time; but the militia ran like sheep chased by dogs.\u201d</p> <p>After the war, Ball remained in Baltimore, living as a free man and eventually purchasing land for a home. This peace would be short, however: in 1830, he was seized as a fugitive slave and sold to a plantation in Georgia. Although he eventually escaped and returned to the north, living outside Philadelphia, he never was able to reunite with his family.\u00a0</p>", "geometryPoiId": "", "firstName": "Charles", "middleName": "", "lastName": "Ball", "quickFacts": [{"id": "F7A67C96-173F-4675-B374-7E3D3A1818B2", "value": "Navy sailor", "name": "Significance"}, {"id": "7F812988-263D-4233-81CF-6E7A89621004", "value": "Calvert County Maryland", "name": "Place of Birth"}, {"id": "5E9CA71F-E57B-4222-BBD3-1A225E2351C2", "value": "c. 1781", "name": "Date of Birth"}], "credit": ""}

However, Robinson did not receive his freedom and was eventually sold into the deep South.\u00a0<br /> <br /> In 1814, General Andrew Jackson needed more men to join his ranks in order to defend New Orleans from the British. As he traveled to the city, he asked enslavers if they would allow their enslaved men to fight in the battle. Many agreed, including Robinson\u2019s new enslaver. During the military training of these enslaved men, their owners encouraged Jackson to tell the men that if the battle was won, they would all earn their freedom. Robinson, alongside many other enslaved African American men, fought in and won the Battle of New Orleans on January 8, 1815.<br /> <br /> However, Jackson ordered them all to return home to their enslavers. Upon hearing this, Robinson pointed a pistol at Jackson. (It was not loaded, but Jackson did not know that at the time.) He asked Jackson why he promised freedom if he did not intend on following through. Jackson replied, \u201cYou are not my property, and I cannot take another man\u2019s property and set it free.\u201d Robinson also stated that Jackson made a speech warning people to never again arm African Americans because they would fight for their freedom, stating that \u201cbefore a slave of mine should go free, I would put him in a barn and burn him alive.\u201d<br /> <br /> When Robinson returned home, he asked his enslaver if he could be freed for his service but was denied and almost punished for even questioning his status.\u00a0<br /> <br /> Although it is unclear when Robinson was freed, he appears in the 1840, 1850, and 1860 U.S. Censuses as a free man. Robinson resettled in Ohio, then Detroit, Michigan. He married, had children, wrote a narrative describing his experiences under the pen name James Roberts, and was celebrated on Defender\u2019s Day every year until his death in 1868 at 115 years old.<br /> <br /> However, his military accomplishments were not nationally acknowledged until 2019.

Some credit Jennings rather than Dolley Madison with saving the portrait of George Washington painted by Gilbert Stuart from the burning White House in 1813, but perhaps Jennings\u2019 most valuable contribution to history is his memoir, \u201c<a href=\"https://archive.org/details/coloredmansremin00jenn\">A Colored Man\u2019s Reminiscences of James Madison</a>.\u201d Although this document, published in a magazine in 1863 and again as a memoir in 1865, allows us to know much more about James Madison, little is known about Jennings himself.</p> <p>Jennings was born into slavery on James Madison\u2019s Virginia plantation, Montpelier, in 1799. He was the son of a female slave of mixed African and American Indian heritage, and English trader Benjamin Jennings. Although plantation life was undoubtedly hard, Jennings reflected that slaves were treated with respect, and that he \u201cnever knew [Madison] to strike a slave, although he had over one hundred; neither would he allow an overseer to do it.\u201d As a house slave and personal servant to such an important statesman as James Madison, Jennings was allowed a basic education. Unlike most slaves of the time, he was literate, educated in mathematics, and could even play the violin. In 1809, he accompanied the Madisons as they moved to the White House. Jennings spent his teenage years as a slave there, likely serving as a butler and serving on the family and their guests.</p> <p>Jennings\u2019 memoir reveals intimate details of life in the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/white-house.htm\">White House</a>, especially on the evening of August 23, 1814, when an invading British army arrived in Washington, D.C. He reflects that \u201cMrs. Madison ordered dinner to be ready at 3, as usual.\u201d As Jennings and the other slaves prepared the dinner, word arrived that the British had landed. Frenzied, Dolley Madison carried off only \u201cthe silver in her reticule, as the British were thought to be but a few squares off, and were expected at every moment.\u201d As for the <a href=\"http://www.georgewashington.si.edu/portrait/\">Lansdowne portrait</a>, Jennings attributes its salvation to door-keeper John Sus\u00e9 and the president\u2019s gardener, Magraw.</p> <p>After two terms of the presidency, the Madisons returned to Montpelier in 1817. Jennings was promoted to James Madison\u2019s primary manservant, responsible for dressing and shaving James as well as accompanying him on trips, a position which he held until James Madison\u2019s death in 1836.</p> <p>In 1822, Jennings married Fanny Gordon, a slave on a neighboring plantation, and had five children together. Despite being married for 22 years, Jennings and his wife never spent more than a weekend together at a time. The same year as Fanny\u2019s death, Dolley Madison sold the Montpelier estate. Jennings was retained as Mrs. Madison\u2019s personal servant, however was sold to pay off debt in 1848. Shortly after, he was purchased and freed by Massachusetts senator Daniel Webster.</p> <p>Jennings was freed in Washington, D.C., home to one of the largest populations of free people of color in the United States. Almost immediately, Jennings began working with white abolitionists to arrange one of the largest \u2013 albeit unsuccessful \u2013 slave revolts in the United States. In April 1848, 77 slaves were sent aboard the schooner <em>Pearl </em>to freedom in the north. Although obviously opposed to slavery, Jennings seemed to harbor no ill-will to his former owners. Jennings described James Madison as \u201cone of the best men that ever lived,\u201d and Dolley Madison as \u201ca remarkably fine woman\u201d in his memoir.</p> <p>Through working in the Pension Office, a unit of the Department of the Interior, Jennings was able to save enough money to purchase a home in Washington.

Five years later, his name appears in French records as the sakom who welcomed the French to his summer village on the southeastern shore of Somes Sound (near present-day Acadia National Park). Of course, Asticou and his people lived a whole and complete life outside of European documentation. As was typical of European colonizer documentation,much of what is recorded about 'Chief Asticou,' including his name, may be incorrect.<br /> <br /> In his paper, <em>Naming the Dawnland, </em>George Neptune (Passamaquoddy) shares, \"According to native speakers, Astuwikuk is a location near Northeast Harbor. The root of the place name, astuwi, is translated as \u201cmoving toward each other,\u201d \u201ccoming into contact with each other,\u201d or \u201cface-to-face.\u201d The ending kuk denotes a place, so astuwikuk can be defined as \u201cmeeting place....Based on the survival of the place name, I propose that Astuwikuk may not have been the Chief\u2019s name, but the name of the location he represented.\"<br /> <br /> As sakom of an Algonquin-speaking community inhabiting the Mount Desert Island area, Asticou headed a district that formed part of a political confederacy known as Mawooshen. Headed by a grandchief, Bashaba of Penobscot, this was an inter-tribal alliance of neighboring <a href=\"https://www.abbemuseum.org/about-the-wabanaki-nations\">Wabanaki </a>groups in Maine, each with their own districts and headed by their own chiefs. Complex family relationships, political negotiations, and trade networks existed between these districts.\u00a0Chiefs like Asticou always headed a much larger extended family and several closely related families formed clusters sometimes identified as clans or kin-groups.\u00a0Chief Asticou was the son of Chief Bashabez. Chief Asticou, like many Chiefs of his time, obtained his position through his father.\u00a0\u00a0<br /> <br /> After Bashabez's death in 1615,\u00a0Chief Asticou of the Mount Desert Island area became his successor in a time of growing turmoil. Chief Asticou's domain included not only Mount Desert Island, but also its hinterland encompassing the Sullivan and Union River drainages. (Sullivan River runs into Frenchman Bay on the east side of Mount Desert Island, and Union River flows into Blue Hill Bay on the island\u2019s west side). Asticou\u2019s district stretched beyond the Schoodic Peninsula as far east as the Narraguagus River, and probably west of Naskeag Point to the Benjamin River, and from there inland.\u00a0This eastern territory was important for thousands of years of trade and transportation, and in the 1600s, due to the contact with European colonizers.<br /> <br /> Within a few decades of contact by Europeans, up to 90 percent of the Wabanaki perished in this American Indian holocaust. We do not know if Chief Asticou survived the onslaught. Two major waves of European diseases swept the Wabanaki homeland from 1616 to 1619 and then again from 1632 to 1634. It is unknown of Chief Asticou was killed by these diseases or died of other means. He was recorded 'sick unto death' in a French document dated 1616. Another French document recorded \"When we arrived at Asticou\u2019s cabins [at Manchester Point, on the eastern shore of Somes Sound], we found him truly sick. But not unto death, for it was only a cold that troubled him; so having assured ourselves of his good condition, we had plenty of leisure to go and visit this place...\" English colonial attacks on French settlements within Asticou's demand also took place around this time. it is possible that Chief Asticou survived for his name is the first in a group of six \"Sagamores to the East and North-east\" recorded by English setter William Wood's 1634 documentation.<br /> <br /> <br /> Sources:<br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/acad/learn/historyculture/wabanaki-people.htm\">Asticou's Island Domain</a>.\u00a0<br /> <a href=\"https://www.abbemuseum.org/educatorhub\">Naming the Dawnland, by George Neptune</a>, Passamaquoddy.

She is best remembered in New Hampshire for the bronze birdbath, now in the Meriden Bird Sanctuary, that she made to commemorate the presentation of Percy MacKaye\u2019s <i>Sanctuary: A Bird Masque</i>. In 1913, she was awarded the MacMillan Prize from the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors and exhibited seven works in the Panama-Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco in 1915.\u00a0<br /> <br /> Annetta Johnson began her art training at the Columbus Art School before coming to New York to study at the Art Students League.

For two years, she assisted the prominent sculptor create the <i>General Logan Monument</i> to be installed in Chicago.<br /> <br /> Annetta Johnson also worked alongside Louis Saint-Gaudens, brother to Augustus and fellow sculptor himself, whom she married in 1898. The couple then moved to Ohio and gave birth to their son, Paul. At the request of Augustus Saint-Gaudens, the three joined him in Cornish, New Hampshire in 1902. The family continued to summer there after her brother-in-law\u2019s death in 1907 where she assisted her husband complete commissions and created ceramic and terra cotta pottery pieces herself. Aside from her original works, Annetta became the primary assistant to Louis and played important roles in the creation of sculptures attributed to her husband. This including modeling portions of <i>Electricity</i> at Union Station in Washington, DC and the final carving of <i>Painting</i> at the St. Louis Art Museum.\u00a0<br /> <br /> Throughout her life, Annetta remained a reformer and activist. She was a member of the Woman\u2019s Christian Temperance Union and the Equal Suffrage League in Cornish. In the last decade of her life, she advocated for international peacebuilding institutions writing that \u201cNo people wish war. They are driven by fear and abnormal appeals to their loyalty to country rather than humanity.\u201d Her sculpture <i>Salvation</i> depicts a Christ-like figure rising above the suffering of militarism and alcohol.<br /> <br /> She eventually moved to California where she continued sculpting and worked as an art educator. In 1927, she described her work in a public school, \u201cI am teaching because of the tradition back of me. Surely the years of study and training that I have had ought to be given toward the upbuilding of the real American art, which may come with a younger generation.

As a young adult, she enrolled in the \u2018Normal Art Course\u2019 at Pratt Art Institute in Brooklyn. After graduating in 1894, she worked as a studio assistant to her former modeling instructor, Herbert Adams. He thought very highly of his former pupil and considered her \"the best marble-cutter in America.\" Through Adams, Grimes met Augustus Saint-Gaudens and became his principle assistant and confidante from 1900 until 1907. Saint-Gaudens believed that \u201cthere was no one on whose fidelity to his own mind\u2019s wish he could so wholly rely.\u201d She assisted Saint-Gaudens with <i>The Pilgrim</i> and remained in the studio for a year after his death to finish the uncompleted <i>Phillips Brooks Monument </i>at Trinity Church, Boston.

In 1911, Grimes completed a bust of Bishop Potter for Grace Church in New York City. Several years later, she executed a relief evoking the Legend of Sleepy Hollow for the Washington Irving High School (now the Washington Irving Campus) in Manhattan. Grimes was recognized by the National Sculpture Society, 1915 Panama-Pacific Exhibition, and National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors.<br /> <br /> Grimes was a strong advocate for <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/womenshistory/19th-amendment.htm\">women\u2019s suffrage</a> and other reform causes in both New Hampshire and New York City.<br /> <br /> While the group of well-known artists in Cornish largely dissolved later in her life, Grimes retained strong connections to the community.

An advocate for women and equality, Florence taught and mentored students until her retirement. She is remembered as a tough teacher, a careful and thorough researcher, and a mentor to a generation of archeologists.<br /> <br /> Florence and her father excavated sites together around their home in Arizona while she was a child. She\u00a0received a Bachelors degree in 1927 with a major in English and a minor in anthropology and a Master's degree in 1928 in anthropology, both from the University of Arizona. While working on her Master's degree, Florence consulted with her father, an expert in chemical analysis, from whom she gained skill in precise descriptions of pigments for black pottery. Her Master's thesis distinguished three closely successive stages of pottery, separating three sequential types (Early, Middle and Late Gila Polychrome) and relating them to certain Mexican Indian pottery types.<br /> <br /> Florence began teaching at the University of Arizona in 1928. The following year, 1929, she\u00a0attended the archeological field school at Chaco Canyon run by Edgar L. Hewett, a professor at the University of New Mexico. Hewett was controversial for his time because he allowed, even encouraged, women to attend the field school alongside men. When the University of Arizona began laying off professors due to the war, Florence took a course in statistics, pocketed her savings and went to the University of Chicago, where she earned her doctorate in 1934. For her dissertation, Florence analyzed hundreds of wood and charcoal samples from Chetro Ketl at Chaco Canyon National Monument. When she became an instructor at Chaco Canyon, Florence trained students in artifact analysis. Florence took part in 11 out of 15 seasons between 1929 and 1942.<br /> <br /> Florence's work at Chetro Ketl was seminal for archeology. In addition to her dendrochronology findings, she also identified that the many different styles of pottery in the stratified layers at Chetro Ketl could be analyzed to understand the changes to decoration patterns over time. Florence used tree ring dates to confirm her ceramic chronologies.\u00a0Florence first used statistics to understand how the amounts of each pottery type differed between the midden layers. She then used bits of charcoal found within the layers to date each one. Using this method, she saw how the ancient Chacoans changed their pottery decorations and exactly when they did so. The project was one of the earliest uses of form statistics in archeology, setting a milestone for archeological analysis.<br /> <br /> Beginning in the 1930s, Hawley conducted dendrochronological research across the United States. She did the first tree-ring dating work in the east at Norris Basin in Tennessee. Beginning in 1934, she and others implemented a six-year project to establish tree sequences within the central U.S. People from all over the country send wood samples from all kinds of places, like forest stumps and historic structures, to the University of Chicago laboratory. The results were analyzed, then compiled into master charts for dating ancient sites. In 1937, Florence collected 1,000 living-tree\u00a0specimens\u00a0in eight different states to identify the climate signal recorded by trees across the Midwest. This work was summarized in <em>Tree-Ring Analysis and Dating in the Mississippi Drainage </em>(1941).<br /> <br /> She taught at\u00a0the\u00a0University of New Mexico\u00a0in the Department of Anthropology beginning in 1934 until her retirement in 1971. She taught over 20 courses; indeed, despite teaching more than anyone else in the anthropology department, was paid less than the men. From the late 1950s through the early 1970s, Florence directed\u00a0field schools through the university at ancestral pueblo sites, including at San Gabriel de Yunge, Sapawe, and Tsama. \u00a0Later in her life, she also taught field schools at Ghost Ranch and in the Gallina mountains.\u00a0She continued to work and to teach students after retiring from the university.\u00a0<br /> <br /> In the 1950\u2019s, Florence worked on the Wetherill Project at Mesa Verde National Park. She brought groups of\u00a0Rio Grande Pueblo Indians to Mesa Verde to examine archeological materials in the laboratory and invited their comments. She also worked with Keres-speaking peoples from Acoma, Laguna, Zia, and Santa Ana, and with the Tanoan speakers of Taos on oral tradition studies. Throughout her career, Florence advocated for using ethnography with archeology in order to remember that people made the things archeologists studied, and that their descendants still lived.\u00a0\u00a0<br /> <br /> Florence was an equal rights advocate for men and women, both in economic terms and professional recognition. For her leadership as an archeologist and a woman, she was honored at the \"Daughters of the Desert\" symposium and featured in a traveling\u00a0Smithsonian\u00a0exhibit of the same name. She served as President of the\u00a0American Society for Ethnohistory\u00a0in 1969 and in 1987.\u00a0The University of New Mexico awarded Florence an honorary doctorate of letters in 1988.<br /> <br /> Full image credit:<br /> Florence Hawley Ellis at Sapawe, 1959.

And how did history come to misremember the true details of her life?</i></h3> <p>\u00a0</p> <h4>Childhood</h4> <p>Sometime around 1597, a girl named Amonute was born the daughter of Powhatan, a paramount chief (<i>mamanitowik</i>) who had brought numerous tribes together under a powerful alliance. The identify of Pocahontas\u2019s mother is unknown, evidence supports that her marriage to Powhatan was not a political one. And since their people followed a matrilineal pattern of inheritance, Pocahontas was not in line to inherit political power.<br /> <br /> However, she would still enjoy a greater degree of wealth and safety as Powhatan\u2019s daughter. For example, Amonute was raised in Werowocomoco, her father\u2019s town, which was in a secure location and guarded by forty warriors. It was there she earned the nickname \u201cPocahontas,\u201d meaning \u201cplayful\u201d or \u201cmischief.\u201dBut childhood was not all fun and games at Werowocomoco.<br /> <br /> Pocahontas would have been expected to learn a wide variety of skills before she reached marriageable age. Women in Virginia Indian culture had many responsibilities, including farming, building and maintaining the home, preparing food, collecting water, edible plants, and firewood, as well as making essential items like clothing, pottery, baskets, utensils, and rope.<br /> <br /> But the rhythms of daily life in Tsenacomoco were about to change. In May 1607, when Pocahontas was about ten years old, the English arrived and built a settlement they called Jamestown just a day\u2019s journey south of Werowocomoco.<br /> <br /> In December of that year, an English soldier named Captain John Smith was captured by Opechancanough, the brother of Powhatan, and brought to Werowocomoco. In his journals, John Smith describes being subjected to a series of ceremonies during his stay with the paramount chief. Famously, he describes his head being lain on two large stones and, just before his head is struck, a young girl named Pocahontas throwing herself over him to spare his life.<br /> <br /> The notion that a ten-year-old girl would have held sway over the decisions of Powhatan and his advisors is suspicious. Historians suspect that Smith either misinterpreted or embellished this event. One theory is that what Smith actually experienced was an adoption ritual. In addition to creating new heirs through marriage, symbolic adoption was a common way to expand one\u2019s power in Powhatan\u2019s culture. Having undergone the ritual, Smith and his countrymen would have been expected to respect Powhatan as their paramount leader. For example, in the days following the event Smith writes,<br /> <br /> \u201cPowhatan\u2026came unto him and told him now they were friends, and presently he should go to Jamestown, to send him two great guns, and a grindstone, for which he would give him the Country of Capahowosick, and for ever esteem him as his son Nantaquoud.\u201d<br /> <i>The Generall Historie of Virginia, New England & the Summer Isles </i>by Captain John Smith (1624)<br /> <br /> Smith did not mention the adoption in his writings until 1624, preferring to tell the story of Pocahontas\u2019s mercy instead. Perhaps he thought it made for a better story. It is also possible he thought that the latter story would be more attractive to potential supporters of the colony. \u00a0<br /> <br /> As a result of their meeting at Werowocomoco, Smith and the Jamestown colonists had a cooperative albeit tenuous relationship with Powhatan. Returning to Jamestown, Smith sent other gifts in lieu of the guns that Powhatan requested, and over the following months, Powhatan sent food and furs to the starving colonists.<br /> <br /> Pocahontas was sometimes a member of the envoys Powhatan sent. She had learned some English from Thomas Hunt, a teenage boy the colonists had dispatched to live at Werowocomoco. She was even responsible, as Smith describes, for negotiating the release of political prisoners.<br /> <br /> While it is clear that Smith developed a respect and admiration for Pocahontas during her visits, the nature of their relationship was not romantic, as she was still a child when Smith permanently departed Virginia in 1609. At some point during this time, John Smith continued her English language instruction. He recorded perhaps the only full sentences that remain from her language:<br /> <br /> <i>\"Kekaten pokahontas patiaquagh ningh tanks manotyens neer mowchick rawrenock audowgh </i>(Bid Pokahontas bring hither two little Baskets, and I will give her white beads to make her a chaine.)<br /> <i>Mowchick woyawgh tawgh noerach kaquere mecher </i>(I am verie hungrie, what shall I eate?)<br /> <i>Casa cunnakack, peya quagh acquintan uttasantasaough? </i>(In how many daies will there come hither any more English ships?)\"<br /> <i>The Generall Historie of Virginia, New England & the Summer Isles </i>by Captain John Smith (1624)</p> <h4>Young Adulthood</h4> <p><br /> By the time Pocahontas was 13 years old, she was married to a young man named Kocoum. Not being in line for a political position, she would have been free to choose her husband. The couple lived together for about three years, but Kocoum\u2019s fate is unknown. It is also unknown whether the couple had a child together. Whatever the case, a plot was underway that would irreversibly change the course of Pocahontas\u2019s life.<br /> <br /> In the years since her childhood trips to Jamestown, relations between the colonists and Pocahontas\u2019s people had deteriorated. Several factors, including a drought, led Powhatan to stop trading with the English. In return the English began to lead violent raids on surrounding towns. Powhatan\u2019s goal became clear: he wanted the English gone from his country.<br /> <br /> As part of this warfare, prisoners were frequently captured and exchanged between the Indians and colonists. Samuel Argall, a recent arrival to the Jamestown colony, devised a plan to kidnap Pocahontas and bring her to Jamestown in hopes that she would become a powerful bargaining chip in negotiations with her father.<br /> <br /> His plan was successful, and in 1613 Pocahontas was separated from her family and taken to Jamestown. And as negotiations and hostilities showed no sign of resolving, Pocahontas remained a hostage as the months went by. We cannot know what toll this had on Pocahontas, as her thoughts were never recorded. Scholar of Pocahontas Dr. Camilla Townsend suggests,<br /> <br /> \u201cThe women in Pocahontas\u2019s world grew up knowing they might be kidnapped by enemy war parties, forced to change their allegiance and their identity. It had almost certainly happened to girls known to her; some of the women living in Werowocomoco had not originally come by choice. The event was always\u2026traumatic, but the women also understood that they would be treated kindly\u2026that they might hope to become wives rather than slaves. But these English men, Pocahontas knew, were different. They had different agendas.\u201d<br /> (<i>Pocahontas and the Powhatan Dilemma, Camilla Townsend (2004)</i><br /> <br /> While a prisoner, Pocahontas was sent to the nearby settlement of Henrico. There, she would be instructed in Christianity and English by a young Reverend Alexander Whitaker and be cared for by his servants. Whitaker\u2019s mission in coming to the Virginia colony was to convert the Indians, and Pocahontas would be his first test. On Sundays, when Whitaker spent the day in town to preach, Pocahontas would have interacted with the wider community, including a man named John Rolfe.<br /> <br /> Rolfe had recently come from England as an aspiring merchant. He was accompanied by his pregnant wife, though both she and their newborn child would not survive the journey. A widower in a new world, Rolfe seems to have quickly fallen in love with Pocahontas. Though 12 years his junior, she too had been separated from her spouse by unfortunate circumstances. Even if Kocoum was still alive at that time, the church would not have recognized a \u201cpagan\u201d marriage, leaving Rolfe free to pursue Pocahontas.<br /> <br /> A year passed and the question of Pocahontas\u2019s ransom wore on. Sir Thomas Dale, acting governor of the colony, led a fleet of ships to see Powhatan at Werowocomoco, bringing Pocahontas and Rolfe along. When they arrived, Powhatan was not at home, and they sailed on to the town of Matchcot. There, Pocahontas spoke with two of her brothers, probably telling them of Rolfe\u2019s interest in marrying her.<br /> <br /> The brothers stayed onboard as \u201ccollateral\u201d while Rolfe went to speak with Opechancanough, Powhatan\u2019s brother. Simultaneously, Dale was given a letter written by Rolfe asking his permission to marry Pocahontas. Both Opechancanough and Dale agreed to the arrangement. Opechancanough also promised to return all English weapons within fifteen days, which appeased Dale. Hostilities, for a short while, would cease.<br /> <br /> Why would Pocahontas agree to such an arrangement? Perhaps she did care for Rolfe. She may have seen him as a worthy option, a well-liked gentleman who was willing to make sacrifices in order to be with her. There are several other explanations, too. Having been a hostage for over a year, she may have seen marriage as an improvement on her situation. Additionally, it was a standard as well as respected practice to marry among the enemy as a way of resolving conflicts. We cannot ever know for certain how Pocahontas and her husband felt, though it is clear that the fairytale love story that emerged in American culture years later was not the full picture.<br /> <br /> Thus, in April 1614, Pocahontas was baptized \u201cRebecca\u201d and married to John Rolfe. They moved to a house with land enough to grow food and, famously, tobacco. The strain of tobacco that Rolfe developed would go on to make the colony profitable and permanent. It is possible that Pocahontas shared with him her people\u2019s techniques for processing tobacco. They had servants to help them with their housework, and some of them were likely Indian. In 1615, the couple had a son, who they named Thomas. For two years, Pocahontas lived a domestic life.<br /> <br /> But in 1616, she and Rolfe were asked to cross the sea. In April, they sailed to London with their son Thomas, Thomas Dale, and a group of native servants and nobles. These included some of Pocahontas\u2019s servants and relatives, including Powhatan\u2019s advisor and son-in-law Uttamatomakin. Powhatan, through Pocahontas\u2019s marriage, was able to send a delegation to England in order to gather more information about his enemy.<br /> <br /> Lady Rebecca, as she was known in England, was taken on a tour of London society. She attended, for example, a \u201cmasque,\u201d an elaborate play, hosted by King James. The Virginia Company of London, who funded her stay, hoped that the \u201cIndian princess\u201d would distract the public and its investors from its troubled finances.<br /> <br /> For all the good press Pocahontas generated for the Virginia colony, an impression too was made on herself and the other Indians in her party. Uttamatomakin was able to report back to Powhatan what he experienced.<br /> <br /> Pocahontas also sat for a portrait while she was in London. Engraved by the Dutch-German artist Simon Van De Passe, there are some interesting details in the portrait which may have been requested by Pocahontas herself. For example, the name used in the byline is Matoaka, her private family name, instead of her more recognizable but also childish nickname Pocahontas.<br /> <br /> Another place where Pocahontas\u2019s voice may be heard is in an account by John Smith of the last time he saw Pocahontas, one autumn day at in Brentford:<br /> <br /> \u201cYou did promise Powhatan what was yours should bee his, and he the like to you; you called him father being in his land a stranger, and by the same reason so much I doe you\u2026Were you not afraid to come into my fathers Countrie, and caused feare in him and all his people (but mee) and feare you here I should call you father; I tell you then I will, and you shall call mee childe, and so I will bee for ever and ever your Countrieman. They did tell us alwaies you were dead, and I knew no other till I came to Plimoth; yet Powhatan did command Uttamatomakkin to seeke you, and know the truth, because your Countriemen will lie much.\u201d<br /> <i>The Generall Historie of Virginia, New England & the Summer Isles </i>by Captain John Smith (1624)<br /> <br /> Then, in March, Pocahontas and her family made to depart for home. Just before their departure, Rolfe was given a sum of money to go towards the conversion of the Virginia Indians to Christianity. As they ventured down the Thames towards the ocean, something wasn\u2019t right. Many of the Indians in the party were ill, and soon Pocahontas and her son Thomas fell too ill to continue. Pocahontas would die and be buried there, in the town of Gravesend, at the age of 20.</p> <h4>Legacy</h4> <p><br /> Thomas survived his illness, and while John Rolfe initially tried to care for his son himself, he decided to send Thomas to live with his brother Henry in England instead of bringing him back to Virginia. Rolfe would remarry, dying of an illness himself at the age of 37. Thomas Rolfe would not return to Virginia until he was in his 20s. Amid conflicts, Thomas was forced to choose sides in a war between his mother\u2019s and his father\u2019s people. Not surprisingly, he sided with those that had raised him. He and his family became elite members of the colony.<br /> <br /> Despite only living to the age of twenty, Pocahontas\u2019s life was the stuff of legends. Indeed, Pocahontas\u2019s story has become legendary. Now that you\u2019ve read what we know about Pocahontas\u2019s life, what do you think about the stories you grew up hearing about her? Why do you think those stories were told? What do you think Pocahontas herself would have wanted people in the future to learn from her story?</p> <p><i></i></p>", "geometryPoiId": "", "firstName": "Pocahontas", "middleName": "", "lastName": "", "quickFacts": [{"id": "F7A67C96-173F-4675-B374-7E3D3A1818B2", "value": "Involvement in early relations between English colonists and Native peoples", "name": "Significance"}, {"id": "7F812988-263D-4233-81CF-6E7A89621004", "value": "Tsenacomoco (coastal Virginia)", "name": "Place of Birth"}, {"id": "5E9CA71F-E57B-4222-BBD3-1A225E2351C2", "value": "c. 1597", "name": "Date of Birth"}, {"id": "3905576C-509A-49F5-A8EE-B4CF14529BBB", "value": "Gravesend, England", "name": "Place of Death"}, {"id": "8F2D2A55-2E87-4DF3-8E09-8520B5A5B7FD", "value": "March 1617", "name": "Date of Death"}, {"id": "E0CEB20D-33EA-4A2E-8444-DE8D7D572CA7", "value": "Gravesend, England", "name": "Place of Burial"}, {"id": "87BFD41C-3E7B-45DA-9CE0-1AA7C093B2A5", "value": "St. George\u2019s Church", "name": "Cemetery Name"}], "credit": ""}

His images adorned the parlors of millions of American households and aided in the effort to create the world's first national park. Jackson was also an accomplished artist who recorded his experiences as a young man. His drawings and paintings provide valuable insights to life in a time when America was suffering through the Civil War and venturing westward in search of a national identity.<br /> <br /> Growing up in Keeseville, New York, the oldest of seven children, William Henry Jackson was born to George Hallock Jackson and Harriet Maria Allen on April 4, 1843. Harriet was a talented watercolorist, and Jackson had the opportunity to learn from her at a young age. He spent much of his childhood mastering the arts of drawing and painting. At the age of 10, Jackson was given the book <em>The American Drawing Book: A Manual for the Amateur </em>by John Gadsby Chapman.\u00a0From this book, Jackson learned how to use perspective and form, color, and composition. As a teenager, Jackson was introduced to photography in Troy, New York, and Rutland, Vermont. There, he worked as an assistant in a photographer\u2019s studio, helping to stage and retouch photos. During this time, he learned how to use cameras and the darkroom techniques of the time.<br /> <br /> Jackson might have continued to learn his trade and settle into a stable and lucrative career, but events beyond his control would soon take him in a new direction. In August of 1862, the 19-year old William Henry Jackson enlisted as a member of the Light Guard from Rutland, Vermont. With the exception of occasional guard duty, there was little for the aspiring artist to do. Jackson passed the long, boring hours sketching his friends and scenes of camp life to send home to show his family he was safe. In June of 1863, Jackson\u2019s regiment participated in the climactic Gettysburg campaign, but never saw action in the battle. Soon after his term of enlistment expired, William Henry Jackson returned to civilian life. Luckily, his mother saved the pencil sketches created during his wartime service, and they survive today as a record of an infantryman\u2019s life in the Union army.<br /> <br /> On his return home, the young veteran quickly found employment in another photographic studio. His obvious skills won him a fine salary, which enabled him to buy fancy clothes and live the good life. After a year, during which he had received substantial raises and promotions, he became engaged to a young woman from a prominent family. Every indication pointed to a happy, successful life and career. However, a lover\u2019s spat in 1866 brought Jackson\u2019s world crashing down around him. Too ashamed to face his family after the breakup with his fianc\u00e9, the heartbroken young man decided to leave Vermont and seek his fortune in the gold mines of Montana. Jackson and two friends set out for the western frontier, making their way to Nebraska City, Nebraska Territory \u2013 a jumping off point for freighting caravans headed west. There the three young easterners signed on as bullwhackers for a freight outfit bound for Montana. Despite knowing nothing about oxen or hauling freight, Jackson soon grew proficient in handling the powerful draft animals.<br /> <br /> The hard work and new country did much to mend Jackson\u2019s broken heart. Soon he was back to his old habits of sketching the things he saw and the people he met. Forsaking his dream of striking it rich, Jackson left the freight train near South Pass in Wyoming and headed south for Salt Lake City and eventually California. His experiences in the West struck a chord in Jackson, and he began to realize that documenting the settling of the frontier might become his life\u2019s work.<br /> <br /> With assistance from his father, Jackson established his own photographic studio in Omaha, Nebraska in 1869. He began photographing American Indians from the nearby Omaha reservation and the construction of the Union Pacific Railroad. These photographs came to the attention of Dr. Ferdinand Hayden, who was organizing an expedition that would explore the geologic wonders along the Yellowstone River in Wyoming Territory. Hayden realized that a photographer would be useful in recording what they found. Jackson was invited to participate in the Hayden Geological Survey of 1871. As a member of the survey, he observed and captured via photographs and paintings the wonders of the region that would become Yellowstone National Park. He served as official photographer for the US Geological and Geographical Survey of the Territories until 1878.<br /> <br /> Anyone else might have been daunted by the thought of transporting delicate camera equipment and glass plate negatives across the West, but Jackson\u2019s experience as a bullwhacker would serve him well. The images he brought back caused a sensation. For many years, stories about geysers and waterfalls were thought to be tall tales, but Jackson provided proof of their existence. Public interest resulted in the U.S. Congress officially designating Yellowstone National Park in 1872, and Jackson\u2019s name became a household word.<br /> <br /> For the next seven years, Jackson worked with Dr. Hayden for the United States Geological Survey. The Survey took him to such unique and unexplored places as Mesa Verde and Yosemite, which Jackson documented with thousands of photographs.<br /> <br /> One of his most famous images would be taken in 1873. For years, stories of a mountain with a large cross etched in its side had been circulating, but it wasn\u2019t until Jackson risked climbing Colorado\u2019s Notch Mountain in the heart of the Rocky Mountains for a clear photographic view that its existence was proven. Within a few months of the photograph\u2019s publication, his image of the Mount of the Holy Cross adorned the parlors in thousands of American homes. Jackson\u2019s work for the U.S.G.S. ended in 1878. He continued to work in the West, opening a studio in Denver, Colorado, returning to portrait photography as well as documenting railroad construction to mining towns in the Rockies.<br /> <br /> At an age when most men have already retired, William Henry Jackson embarked on a new career. He chose to return to the paintbrush at the age of 81, working as a muralist for the new U.S. Department of the Interior. \u00a0Jackson\u2019s eye for composition, coupled with the fact that he had experienced the transformation of the West firsthand gave added credibility to his work. Soon his paintings of western scenes were in demand for illustrating books and articles. Jackson completed 100s of paintings, mostly dealing with historic themes such as the Fur Trade, the California Gold Rush and the Oregon Trail. Jackson revisited many of the sites he depicted in his paintings so he could paint them as accurately as possible. For those scenes that predated his own lifetime, he sought out and interviewed surviving participants.\u00a0<br /> <br /> William Henry Jackson died on June 30, 1942 at the age of 99 in New York City from injuries resulting from a fall. Recognized as one of the last surviving Civil War veterans, he was laid to rest in Arlington National Cemetery. His long and active life paralleled the formative years in the life of the United States, and his many contributions as a soldier, bullwhacker, photographer, explorer, publisher, author, artist, and historian have left a lasting legacy that the National Park Service is proud to honor.<br /> <br /> Mount Jackson, just north of the\u00a0Madison River, in the\u00a0Gallatin Range\u00a0of\u00a0Yellowstone National Park\u00a0is named in honor of Jackson.<br /> <br /> The archives of Scotts Bluff National Monument, in Gering, Nebraska, house the <a href=\"https://nps.gov/thingstodo/the-william-henry-jackson-collection.htm\">world's largest collection of original William Henry Jackson sketches, paintings, and photographs.</a><br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/museum/exhibits/whj/index.html\">A virtual exhibition of the Scotts Bluff National Monument William Henry Jackson collection</a> is available thanks to the NPS Museum Management Program.\u00a0<br /> \u00a0", "geometryPoiId": "", "firstName": "William", "middleName": "Henry", "lastName": "Jackson", "quickFacts": [{"id": "F7A67C96-173F-4675-B374-7E3D3A1818B2", "value": "Painter and photographer known for his images of the American West", "name": "Significance"}, {"id": "7F812988-263D-4233-81CF-6E7A89621004", "value": "Keeseville, New York", "name": "Place of Birth"}, {"id": "5E9CA71F-E57B-4222-BBD3-1A225E2351C2", "value": "April 4, 1843", "name": "Date of Birth"}, {"id": "3905576C-509A-49F5-A8EE-B4CF14529BBB", "value": "New York, New York", "name": "Place of Death"}, {"id": "8F2D2A55-2E87-4DF3-8E09-8520B5A5B7FD", "value": "June 30, 1942", "name": "Date of Death"}, {"id": "E0CEB20D-33EA-4A2E-8444-DE8D7D572CA7", "value": "Arlington, VA", "name": "Place of Burial"}, {"id": "87BFD41C-3E7B-45DA-9CE0-1AA7C093B2A5", "value": "Arlington National Cemetery", "name": "Cemetery Name"}], "credit": ""}

Wilson enlisted in I Troop, Ninth U.S. Cavalry, on August 21, 1889, in Saint Paul, Minnesota. Before joining the cavalry, he was a skilled upholsterer. He quickly rose in rank to corporal.\u00a0<br /> <br /> On November 19, 1890, the Ninth U.S. Cavalry left its posts in Nebraska and Wyoming en route to the Sioux reservations to settle the nerves of the Indian Agents. The Indian Agents and White settlers in the area were panicked due to the Sioux participating in the Ghost Dance. Many whites living near the reservations regarded the Ghost Dance as a prelude to renewed American Indian militance, although it was a religious ritual that had spread among American Indian tribes throughout the West.<br /> <br /> The Ghost Dance found many backers among the Sioux. The Ghost Dance blended traditional indigenous rituals with the expectation that a messiah would come and restore the Sioux and others to their traditional lands and former glory. To the Sioux the Ghost Dance held out hope of a return to days when they roamed at liberty and the bison were plentiful.<br /> <br /> Ultimately more than 5,000 soldiers from several regiments converged on the Sioux reservations. While the increased soldier presence was intended to bring stability to the area, it had the opposite effect. As December unfolded, increasingly fervent ceremonies took place throughout the reservations. Groups of Sioux were leaving the reservations, heading into the hinterland to avoid Army scrutiny and control.<br /> <br /> In late December 1890 a battalion of Ninth Cavalry Buffalo Soldiers left the Pine Ridge Agency on patrol pursuing Sioux groups that had left the reservations. The battalion was led by Major Guy V. Henry and comprised troopers from D, F, I, and K Troops. On the evening of December 29, the battalion was about 50 miles away from the Pine Ridge Agency in South Dakota. As the troopers were feeding their horses and making dinner some Army scouts entered the Buffalo Soldier camp and alerted them about the Wounded Knee Massacre that took place earlier in the day. The battalion was ordered to return immediately to Pine Ridge. Most of the battalion arrived at the Pine Ridge agency as the sun rose on December 30.\u00a0<br /> <br /> The battalion supply train was about 90 minutes behind the main battalion. Two miles from their destination the supply train was attacked by 50 Sioux warriors. At the first signs of the attack Captain John S. Loud, in charge of the supply train, circled his wagons for protection. Captain Loud knew the situation was desperate; bullets were coming from multiple directions. He scribbled a note to Major Henry asking for help.<br /> <br /> Corporal Wilson was nearby and overheard Captain Loud asking for volunteers to deliver the message. Wilson volunteered. He mounted his horse and rode the two miles to the agency and Major Henry. Ten Sioux warriors saw Wilson leave the encircled wagons and pursued him. Wilson made it safely to the agency to raise the alarm.<br /> <br /> Major Henry ordered the battalion to resaddle its horses after Wilson delivered the note. They rode to the rescue of their comrades and the supply train. Once the battalion arrived, the Sioux warriors retreated.<br /> <br /> For his actions that day, Wilson received the Medal of Honor on September 17, 1891. His Medal of Honor citation simply states \u201cbravery.\u201d On December 17, 1891, a more detailed citation was published in General Order 100. It praised Wilson \u201cFor gallantry in carrying a message for assistance through country occupied by the enemy. When the wagon train under escort of Captain Loud was attacked by hostile Sioux Indians, near the Pine Ridge Agency, South Dakota.\u201d Wilson was the last American soldier to receive the Medal of Honor for actions on American soil.<br /> <br /> Two years after receiving the Medal of Honor, Wilson was stationed at Fort Duchesne near Vernal, Utah. On September 5, 1893, while traveling to Denver, Colorado, after participating in an Army marksmanship event, Wilson deserted. He made his way back to Hagerstown, Maryland. The Army never apprehend Wilson, who lived the rest of his days in Hagerstown rarely talking about his military service.\u00a0<br /> <br /> William O. Wilson died on January 18, 1928, at the age of 58.

Baker was the son of a white French father and a Black American mother. He grew up with his family in eastern Wyoming where he learned horsemanship and roping skills. Along with learning the skills of a frontiersman Baker had a fondness for education. He learned French from his father and later studied Spanish, Russian, and Chinese.<br /> <br /> On July 27, 1882, at the age of 16, Baker enlisted in the Ninth U.S. Cavalry. During this enlistment he was promoted to trumpeter. Baker reenlisted on August 25, 1887, in the Tenth U.S. Cavalry. While in the Tenth he held various positions including chief trumpeter, quartermaster sergeant, and eventually sergeant major, the highest enlisted rank in a regiment.<br /> <br /> Baker traveled with the Tenth Cavalry from Western forts to Tampa, Florida, to await transport to Cuba during the Spanish American War. On the morning of July 1, 1898, Sergeant Major Baker and the rest of the Tenth Cavalry took up their positions around San Juan Heights in Cuba. The Tenth Cavalry along with the First Cavalry and the First Volunteer Cavalry, the Rough Riders, held the far right of the American line that hot, humid morning. Their position was in tall grass along the San Juan River.<br /> <br /> The Spanish troops were entrenched on San Juan Hill and Kettle Hill firing down on the Tenth\u2019s position. The Spanish had found the range of the cavalry, and their rifle fire began to take a serious toll. Baker later wrote in his journal about this time, recounting, \u201cthe atmosphere seemed perfectly alive with flying missiles from bursting shells overhead, and rifle bullets, which seemed to have an explosive effect.\u201d\u00a0<br /> <br /> Walking up and down the line of the Tenth\u2019s position talking to the troops, Baker reassured them while bullets whizzed by. As Baker made his rounds, he heard a groan and saw Private Lewis Marshall of C Troop wounded and struggling face down in the San Juan River. Baker ignored the advice of other soldiers who told him it was too dangerous to try to save Marshall. Baker pulled Marshall from the water and carried him to safety. After carrying Marshall to safety, Baker alerted the regimental doctor to attend to Marshall\u2019s wounds. Marshall survived thanks to Baker\u2019s actions.<br /> <br /> Baker joined the rest of the Tenth Cavalry in their fighting up the San Juan Heights. During the battle, Baker was wounded by shrapnel in his left side and left arm. He continued picking his way through barbed wire entanglements on his way to the summit. He later wrote that the troopers \u201cadvanced rapidly\u2026under a galling, converging fire from the enemy\u2019s artillery and infantry.\u201d Finally, Baker and the remaining members of the Tenth U.S. Cavalry reached the summit and forced the Spaniards to retreat.<br /> <br /> On July 3, 1902, Baker received the Medal of Honor for his gallantry on July 1, 1898, as a member of the Philippine Scouts.

Attending the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boaf/learn/historyculture/abiel-smith-school.htm\">Abiel Smith School</a>, Gardner came of age in Beacon Hill\u2019s center of abolition. Historian Hallie Quinn Brown noted, \u201c[Eliza Gardner\u2019s] home was a veritable \u2018Bethel,\u2019 being one of the stations of the famous \u2018Underground Railroad.\u2019\u201d<sup>2</sup> During this time, Gardner became acquainted with local and national anti-slavery leaders, including <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/william-lloyd-garrison.htm\">William Lloyd Garrison</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/lewis-hayden.htm\">Lewis </a>and Harriet Hayden, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/frederick-douglass.htm\">Frederick Douglass</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/harriet-tubman.htm\">Harriet Tubman</a>.<sup>3</sup></p> <p>Eliza Gardner also grew up actively involved in the African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Zion Church. She started teaching Sunday school in 1865, eventually becoming Boston's Sunday school superintendent in the 1880s.<sup>4</sup> During this time, Gardner assumed other leadership positions in the regional AME Zion Church. She served in the Daughters of Conference, which raised money to support ministers and erect churches, and she organized AME Zion Woman\u2019s Home and Foreign Missionary Society, a women-run organization that supported missionaries.<sup>5</sup> Through this work, Gardner supported equality for women in religious institutions, particularly within the church hierarchy. She grew frustrated with male church leaders who often opposed women taking on leadership positions or diminished women's contributions. Gardner protested this injustice in the 1884 AME Zion Church\u2019s General Conference:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\"><em>...if you commence to talk about the superiority of men, if you persist in telling us that after the fall of man we were put under your feet and that we are intended to be subject to your will, we cannot help you in New England one bit.</em><sup>6</sup></p> <p>As Gardner became a respected leader in the AME Zion Church, she also grew as a community leader in Boston. Eliza Gardner became one of the founding members of the Boston-based Black women\u2019s club, the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/womans-era-club.htm\">Woman\u2019s Era Club</a>.<sup>7</sup> Working alongside <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/josephine-st-pierre-ruffin.htm\">Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/maria-l-baldwin.htm\">Maria Baldwin</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/florida-ruffin-ridley.htm\">Florida Ridley</a>, and others, Gardner helped organize the first <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/1895-convention.htm\">National Conference for Colored Women in America</a> in 1895, serving as the convention\u2019s chaplain.<sup>8</sup></p> <p>Gardner continued to blend her religious and moral leadership with her social activism, contributing to the temperance, women\u2019s rights, and anti-lynching movements.<sup>9</sup> In the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, Gardner often spoke at events that commemorated the abolitionist era of her youth, during which she adeptly related the past struggles of Black Americans to the current discrimination they faced. At a 1917 event honoring the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/54th-massachusetts-regiment.htm\">Massachusetts 54<sup>th</sup> Volunteer Infantry Regiment</a>, Gardner, over 90 years old at the time, gave some remarks that echoed this tone:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\"><em>The North...met with defeat in the civil war until it called on the black man, and yet after all the sacrifices of our race he is not considered worthy of this companionship of the whites. Yet as there was no victory without us in the past, so there will be none without us in the future.</em><sup>10</sup></p> <p>Eliza Gardner died in 1922, after many decades of service to her religious and social communities.</p> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <ol> <li>William J.

He was one of three children, two boys and a girl, who were born to Joe Beard and Sarah (McKinnis) Beard. In the 1870 US Census, he and his siblings were\u00a0living with their grandmother Hannah in Jackson County, Mississippi. Shortly after that time he married Ann Moffett and lived\u00a0in Wilmer, Mobile, Alabama. In 1880 US Census, his occupation was\u00a0listed as working in the Timber Industry and had four children (Joseph, William, E. John and Ellen). William and Ann had seven children before her death in 1885.\u00a0\u00a0<br /> <br /> William submitted Homestead Application # 714 on November 21,1877. He built a house and fenced and cultivated about six acres of land. In addition, he also built a stable, corn crib, and other out houses. He eventually farmed a large amount of the land and was able to grow a variety of fruits and vegetables.\u00a0He also raised animals and had a smoke house for storing meat. The Beard family was never hungry and was able to share food with other families when they were in need.\u00a0Although William Beard could read and write, he used an X on his land entry document as his signature.\u00a0<br /> <br /> William Beard had the following witnesses to testify to support his final homestead claim - Jackson Moffett \u2013 the brother of his wife Ann, and Wesley Taylor, a neighbor. \u00a0William Beard's\u00a0brother-in-law Jackson testified on the homestead land application that Beard\u00a0settled in Wilmer/Moffettville, Alabama on September 4,1871. The final Homestead Application was submitted on November 21,1877 for 159.98 acres of land. Beard received his Homestead Land Patent # 364 on December 30,1879.<br /> <br /> In addition to farming the land, William was a logger by trade.\u00a0His last living daughter, Eleanor, provided an account of some of his life during that time. She said that her daddy was a Straw Boss in the logging business which meant that he had to supervise the workers, plus count and document logs that were shipped to other merchants. He also harvested logs and took them up and down the river. Beard\u00a0had a logging team in Alabama and in Mississippi.\u00a0Because he was unable to personally supervise this team in Mississippi, Beard\u00a0lost a large sum of money and had to close the business there. However, the business in Alabama was profitable and employed family members and others in the community.<br /> <br /> William was a Christian by faith.\u00a0His in-laws (Cyrus John Moffett and Rachel Banks Moffett) founded the Moffettville Baptist Church on Wilson Road on December, 1868 and later organized in August, 1876. He served as Chairman of the Deacon Board and\u00a0was actively involved in his community offering counseling and support to people to uphold\u00a0the moral standards of Christ in the Wilmer/ Moffettville community.\u00a0<br /> <br /> <img alt=\"Moffettville Baptist Church Founders\" id=\"||CPIMAGE:7168141|0|\" src=\"/people/images/Moffettville-Baptist-Church-Founders.jpg\" title=\"Moffettville Baptist Church Founders\" /><br /> Moffettville Baptist Church Founders<br /> photo credit: Marcia Green Lamar<br /> <br /> Upon the death of his wife Ann, William continued to raise his children on the farm.\u00a0He later married her sister Sabrie Ella in April, 1889.\u00a0He felt that by marrying Ann \u2018s sister she would better take care of\u00a0the children.\u00a0From this union, they had ten additional children. Sabrie Ella died in 1905. William\u00a0then married Ada Bales Robinson.\u00a0Ada died in 1918. William married once more to Cynthia Ann Adams. Cynthia, a widow, had two sons prior to her marriage to William and later had a daughter. This daughter lived until 2013 and was able to share family information. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br /> <br /> As of today there are few family members who still own or live on parts of this land.

Her parents were <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/joshua-peirce-klingle.htm\">Joshua Peirce Klingle</a>\u00a0and Laura Tiernan. The baby was known throughout her life as Beatrice. The other names given to the baby honored the women in the lives of her parents: Susan was Joshua Klingle's aunt and adoptive mother's name while Juliet was the name of his birth mother. Gay was the name of Laura Tiernan's mother.\u00a0<br /> <br /> Beatrice Klingle lived a privileged life on what was then known as the Linnaean Hill estate started by Joshua Peirce. Few details about her childhood are known. Newspapers described her as \"a popular belle in select society\" in the city of Washington when she was a teenager. Unfortunately, her mother died in 1885 when Beatrice was 18-years-old. <h4>Scandal!</h4> Beatrice caused quite a scandal in Washington in September of 1885.<br /> <br /> On the 15th of September, her father received a note from Beatrice. It was given to him by a servant who had driven her into town. The note was supposed to have said:<br /> <br /> <em>\"Dearest Papa: You won't think it strange and you won't be angry with me. I told you I loved him. I couldn't help it. Now I am off to Baltimore with him to be married, but we shall return to the city to-night, and shall stay at the Hamilton House: now you won't be angry with me, papa, for loving my darling, will you?\"</em><br /> <br /> Klingle assumed that the man his daughter referred to was Edward Irving Darling, a composer who had been socializing in Washington with his mother at the time he and Beatrice met. Edward's mother, Sophronia \"Flora\" Adams Darling, was well connected through her family ties, literary pursuits and legal battles.<br /> <br /> In newspaper accounts, it was believed that Edward Darling was almost a full decade older than Beatrice. In reality, there was only a four year age difference between the two. He visited the Klingle home but Klingle thought that Darling was paying too much attention to Beatrice. Klingle warned his daughter's suitor off and told him that \"anything further than a friendship for his daughter was not desired.\" Though Darling later left his original lodgings at Hamilton House, he remained in Washington and Klingle felt that Darling and Beatrice were still meeting each other in spite of his warning, but could never prove it.<br /> <br /> Beatrice went into the city by carriage on September 15th, and went into a store before having the servant drop her off in town. She claimed she was staying late in town to go to the theater and had the servant deliver the note to her father. Klingle was not fully convinced that his daughter had left Washington right away, as her note suggested, and he spent a tense evening searching for her in the city.<br /> <br /> Newspapers from September 19, 1885 indicate that Edward and Beatrice did in fact go to Baltimore and were married there in the evening of September 15th. Newspapers in Baltimore and Washington ran the following story about the event:<br /> <br /> <em>\"After the marriage, at 8:30 o'clock on Tuesday evening, at the Rev. Mr. Wroth's residence, No. 82 St. Paul street, the young couple went to Barnum's hotel. The father, who did not think his daughter was serious when she wrote in a note to him that she was going to Baltimore to get married, found them at Barnum's on Wednesday after they were married sure enough. They all returned to Washington the same day. The Rev. Mr. Wroth says he was very favorably impressed with both the young lady and the young man. They were very self-possessed, especially the young lady, and as they had a license and were both of age, and wanted to be married, he could not refuse. The license bore date some time previously, showing that the affair had been carefully planned. Mr. Wroth says the young man turned to the witnesses after the ceremony and thanked them, an act of courtesy he never before saw exhibited under such circumstances. The witnesses were persons who had been called in by Mr. Wroth, and were, of course, strangers to the bride and groom.\" -Baltimore Sun, September 19, 1885.</em> <h4>Life after elopement and tragedy</h4> Beatrice and Edward first settled in New York after their marriage. They lived there for a time and had two children while living in the city, their eldest daughter Nancy Adams Peirce Klingle Darling in 1887 and their son Charles Tiernan Darling in 1889. The family moved to Detroit some time before 1890. The couple had one more child, Harvey Adams Darling who was born and died in 1890. Beatrice took care of the children and managed the home while Edward composed several \"light operas\" and worked with others on compositions. He submitted articles to political and historical journals and was well connected through his own network and that of his mother.<br /> <br /> Edward took up a job as manager for the Grinnel Brothers Music House in Detroit in the 1890s. During a severe storm, Edward was thrown from a second story window of the Grinnel Brothers building. He was apparently trying to prevent a sign from falling through a large plate glass window when he fell. He broke 27 bones and required extensive medical care, but survived the fall. He was not the same after the accident.<br /> <br /> On July 4, 1892, Beatrice received word that her father had died suddenly in Washington, DC. By that point, most of the land that had been Beatrice's childhood home had been aquired by the federal government and made into Rock Creek Park. Klingle was still a leading citizen and had amassed a great amount of wealth. As the only child, Beatrice inherited a large portion of the estate (the rest went to her step mother, Klingle's second wife). The estimated value of her inheritance at the time was rumored to be close to $1,000,000 in real estate and government bonds. Edward and Beatrice traveled to Washington for the funeral and to deal with the inheritance. Though somewhat recovered from his injuries, Edward took violently ill while staying in Washington, supposedly due to drinking bad milk.\u00a0 <h4>A second scandal</h4> Beatrice's name was in all of the papers in 1895. By that point, Edward had been suffering from the lingering effects of his fall and an additional illness for several years. He died on February 13, 1894.\u00a0<br /> <br /> Edward's mother almost immediately accused Beatrice of poisoning him, and claimed that he had made a deathbed declaration stating as much. Beatrice was supposed to have had an accomplice in murdering her husband---the doctor who had been treating him since his fall from the Grinnel Brothers building. Flora Darling brought her suspicions to the District Attorney Frazier of Detroit. Frazier heard the case but ultimately had to dismiss it. However, stating \"the suspicion, while perhaps well founded, was not strong enough to warrant the arrest of the doctor and her daughter-in-law.\" Frazier is also said \"to have announced at the time that should the wife ever marry the doctor the motive would become plain.\"<br /> <br /> Beatrice and Dr. Francis X. Spranger were married publicly at the Corpus Christi cathedral in Baltimore, Maryland on March 6, 1895. They left shortly after for California to honeymoon. <h4>Damning testimony\u00a0</h4> Newspapers all over the country took up the story of the Washington heiress who poisoned her first husband and married the doctor who helped her commit the crime. Flora Adams used her connections and several attorneys were involved in investigating Edward's death. Documents and attestations were put into the court record, including a dying declaration from Edward that stated in part that \"the variety and quantity of drugs he (Dr. Spranger) poured into me was sufficient to justify classing me as an annex to his laboratory. He gave no prescriptions, only medicine.\"<br /> <br /> Edward's detailed account of the treatment he received from his wife and Doctor Spranger accused Beatrice of becoming openly hostile and abusive towards Edward after his injury. He claimed that the reports of any reliance on drugs and alcohol on his part were spread by Beatrice and Dr. Spranger to paint him in a poor light. The testimony provided a timeline that supposedly reported on the instances of poisoning and showed evidence that whenever Edward attempted to travel away from Beatrice and Dr. Spranger, his health improved. The declaration also claimed that when he left for New York on a brief trip in 1893, \"She, with the children, was to go to Washington. She did not go. As soon as I left, December 8, she filed a bill for absolute divorce for drunkenness, non-support, cruelty and assertion, which she expected to obtain with alimony through default.\"\u00a0<br /> <br /> Dr. and Mrs. Spranger vehemently denied the accusations made against them. When the newspapers first picked up the poisoning story a reporter visited them where they were staying in California. Beatrice is reported to have stated \"this charge is simply monstrous, utterly ridiculous, too, when taken into the slightest consideration.\" They claimed that Mrs. Darling was insane and that many of the claims were untrue.<br /> \u00a0As evidence of Flora's mental instabilities and cruelties, they reported that Flora had taken Beatrice and Edward's young daughter, Nancy, and put her in a convent, which traumatized the child. They also used Flora's constant altercations with organizations she was involved in. She was a founding member of organizations like the Daughters of the American Revolution and Daughters of the War of 1812 but was often removed from those boards or left them due to butting heads with others.<br /> <br /> Evidence was collected, testimonies gathered and the news was picked up by newspapers from coast to coast. Flora Adams Darling made sure that the story of the death of her son stayed in the papers and that Beatrice had no rest from suspicion while trying assert her innocence from California.<br /> <br /> Beatrice was never brought up on charges for the possible poisoning of her first husband. She died in Los Gatos, California on June 20, 1895, supposedly of diabetes and the stress of the charges brought against her. She was interred in the vault of friends she and her second husband had made on their honeymoon. Over the months following her death, her will was filed in Washington, DC and it was shown that her estate was not in fact worth $1,000,000. Trusts were set up for Charles and Nancy and Dr. Spranger was one of the men listed by Beatrice for guardianship. Though some newspapers stated her remains would be taken to Detroit, that was not the case and in September of 1897 Beatrice's name appears once again in newspapers. Apparently her remains stayed in a rented alcove in the Gribner family vault. Thieves broke into the crypt and attempted to break into Mrs. Spranger's casket. It was believed the robbers were attempting to relieve her of any valuables that may have been buried with the deceased heiress. Grave markers exist for her in Los Gatos, California as well as in the Peirce family vault in Rock Creek Cemetery in Washington, DC.<br /> \u00a0", "geometryPoiId": "", "firstName": "Beatrice", "middleName": "", "lastName": "Klingle", "quickFacts": [{"id": "7F812988-263D-4233-81CF-6E7A89621004", "value": "Washington, DC", "name": "Place of Birth"}, {"id": "5E9CA71F-E57B-4222-BBD3-1A225E2351C2", "value": "July 18, 1867", "name": "Date of Birth"}, {"id": "3905576C-509A-49F5-A8EE-B4CF14529BBB", "value": "California", "name": "Place of Death"}, {"id": "8F2D2A55-2E87-4DF3-8E09-8520B5A5B7FD", "value": "June 20, 1895", "name": "Date of Death"}, {"id": "E0CEB20D-33EA-4A2E-8444-DE8D7D572CA7", "value": "Los Gatos, California", "name": "Place of Burial"}, {"id": "87BFD41C-3E7B-45DA-9CE0-1AA7C093B2A5", "value": "Oak Hill Memorial Park", "name": "Cemetery Name"}], "credit": ""}

She was the oldest child in a middle-class Jewish family.<br /> <br /> Schwimmer devoted her early career to organizing working women in Hungary. During her twenties, she founded several national associations to improve working conditions and wages for women. She also advocated for birth control, marriage reform, and ending child labor.<br /> <br /> In 1904, Schwimmer was invited to speak at the International Congress of Women in Berlin. She met <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/carrie-chapman-catt.htm\">Carrie Chapman Catt</a>, a leader in the American women's suffrage movement and the president of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/the-internationalist-history-of-the-us-suffrage-movement.htm\">International Woman Suffrage Alliance</a> (IWSA). Under Catt\u2019s mentorship, Schwimmer began to advocate for women\u2019s suffrage in Hungary and became the press secretary of the IWSA in London.<br /> <br /> In 1911, Schwimmer married Paul (or\u00a0P\u00e1l) B\u00e9dy, a journalist.\u00a0They had no children and divorced two years later.</p> <h4>Women\u2019s Suffrage Activism</h4> <p>On July 28, 1914, the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand sparked the outbreak of World War I. Due to hostility toward Hungarians in Great Britain, Schwimmer came to the United States. She became involved with the American suffrage movement. Catt sent Schwimmer on a national tour to gain the support of German-speaking immigrants. In the span of months, she visited 60 cities.<br /> <br /> Schwimmer also used her suffrage work to promote peace. She believed that if women could vote, they could pressure elected officials to support mediation in Europe. Schwimmer also gave lectures, collaborated with peace organizations, and participated in conferences for peace and women\u2019s rights.<br /> <br /> Although Schwimmer was an asset to the American suffragists, she and Catt had different priorities. Schwimmer disagreed with Catt\u2019s single-minded focus on women\u2019s suffrage and shifted her attention to ending the war in Europe.</p> <h4>Anti-War Activism and the Peace Ship</h4> <p>Schwimmer collaborated with American peace activists to urge President Woodrow Wilson and other prominent Americans to intervene in WWI. Although Wilson remained committed to neutrality, Schwimmer convinced Henry Ford to act. In addition to seeking peace, Ford was motivated by publicity and the antisemitic belief that Jewish bankers financed the war for their own gain.<a id=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosika_Schwimmer#/media/File:Schwimmer,_Ford.jpg\" onmouseover=\"return window.status='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosika_Schwimmer#/media/File:Schwimmer,_Ford.jpg'\"><img alt=\"A woman and man sitting with another man standing\" id=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosika_Schwimmer#/media/File:Schwimmer,_Ford.jpg||CPIMAGE:7163541|0|\" src=\"/people/images/rosika-schwimmer-2.jpg\" style=\"width:50%;float:left;margin-top:7.5px;margin-bottom:7.5px;margin-left:7.5px;margin-right:7.5px;\" title=\"Rosika Schwimmer, Henry Ford, and Louis Lochner aboard the Peace Ship Oskar II\" /></a><br /> <br /> In late 1915, Ford joined Schwimmer and other peace activists aboard the \u201cPeace Ship.\u201d The photo at left depicts Schwimmer, Ford, and anti-war activist Louis P. Lochner on the ship. The delegation departed for Stockholm to organize a mediation conference among neutral nations in February 1916. The campaign failed to influence European leaders and was ridiculed by the press. Ford blamed its poor reception on Schwimmer and accused her of mismanaging his money.<br /> <br /> After this effort failed, Schwimmer remained in Europe to advocate for peace. When the war ended in 1918, she became an official and diplomat within Hungary\u2019s new government, until the communist revolutionary B\u00e9la Kun overthrew it in 1919. When Schwimmer refused to serve under his regime, she was exiled from Hungary and returned to the U.S.</p> <h4>United States v. Schwimmer</h4> <p>By the time Schwimmer moved to Chicago in 1921, public opinion had turned against her. During wartime, journalists criticized her peace activism as unpatriotic and depicted her as a troublemaker. Reporters, including \u201cSearchlight\u201d columnist Fred Marvin, frequently questioned her loyalty and accused her of being a German spy, a Bolshevik, the source of Henry Ford\u2019s antisemitism, and a threat to national security. To combat these claims, Schwimmer filed several anti-libel lawsuits, but failed to restore her reputation.<br /> <br /> In December 1924, Schwimmer applied for naturalization. She was convinced that \"getting citizenship is the only means to disprove all the accusations and rumors against me.\u201d Question 22 on a preliminary form asked \u201cIf necessary, are you willing to take up arms in defense of this country?\u201d Schwimmer responded: \u201cI would not take up arms personally.\u201d Due to her pacifist beliefs, she was a conscientious objector to military service.<br /> <br /> Schwimmer also believed that the question did not apply to her. As a woman approaching 50 years old, she was ineligible for combat. At a naturalization hearing, she testified that if taking up arms was a requirement of her citizenship, she would not comply. When naturalization officials objected to Schwimmer\u2019s pacifism, she insisted her beliefs did not diminish her loyalty.<br /> <br /> Some of Schwimmer\u2019s opponents, including the Military Intelligence Association of Chicago, also tried to prevent her from gaining citizenship. The Association was a superpatriotic professional organization for reserve officers who monitored the population for \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201csubversive\u201d people and activities. In 1926, Schwimmer wrote the organization's leader to defend her beliefs. \u201cI have no sense of nationalism, only a cosmic consciousness of belonging to the human family,\u201d she explained. Naturalization officials later used Schwimmer\u2019s statement to claim that she could not be truly committed to the Constitution.<br /> <br /> In late 1927, a Federal District Court Judge in Illinois rejected Schwimmer\u2019s petition for citizenship. The following spring, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the decision. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case.[1] On May 27, 1929, the Court issued its 6-3 decision denying Schwimmer\u2019s eligibility for citizenship.<br /> <br /> The Justices determined that Schwimmer\u2019s influence on others was more harmful than her individual refusal to bear arms. Schwimmer had openly expressed that she intended to defend and contribute to the U.S. through her civic participation, which the Justices believed would spread disloyalty. They argued that Schwimmer\u2019s gender-based argument was also invalid because her gender did not diminish her ability to influence others.</p> <h4>Later Life</h4> <p>After the case, Schwimmer continued to advocate for peace. Her friends and allies remained committed to her quest for citizenship. Due to her diabetes and deteriorating health, Schwimmer was unwilling to restart the extensive citizenship process.\u00a0She also continued to draw the ire of journalists and superpatriotic organizations.<br /> <br /> Near the end of her life, Schwimmer lived in New York City with her sister Franciscka. After a prolonged illness, Schwimmer died at Mount Sinai Hospital on August 3, 1948. Even then, she remained a woman without a country.</p> <h4>Impact</h4> <p>In the 1946 case Girouard v. United States, the Supreme Court overturned its decision in United States. v. Schwimmer. As a result of this ruling, people who apply for citizenship cannot be disqualified for being conscientious objectors.<br /> \u00a0</p> <hr /> <h4>Places of Rosika Schwimmer</h4> <p>[1] The Supreme Court met in the Old Senate Chamber of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/us-capitol.htm\">U.S. Capitol Building</a> between 1860 and 1935.

He is the primary designer of the Precipice and Beehive Trails, as well as many other historic trails in Acadia National Park.<br /> <br /> While park <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/acad/learn/historyculture/founding.htm\">founder </a>George B. Dorr expanded the trail network in the Sieur de Monts Spring area, Brunnow was simultaneously involved in the construction of several of the most rigorous <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/acad/learn/historyculture/historic-trails.htm\">trails </a>on the island. During this time he laid out the Precipice Trail and Orange & Black Path on Newport [Champlain] Mountain and The Beehive Trail. These routes, carefully designed to lead walkers through boulder fields and up precipitous cliffs, testify to the skill of Brunnow for laying our remarkable trails, much like the talents of his predecessors, Herbert Jaques and Waldron Bates. Like Door's memorial trails, Brunnow's trails held to high standards of construction with long rows of cut and uncut steps, yet contained much more iron work.\u00a0\u00a0<br /> <br /> Like Jaques, Brunnow concentrated most of his trail construction on Newport [Champlain] Mountain near his summer <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/acad/learn/historyculture/rusticators-tourism.htm\">cottage </a>known as \"High Seas.' You can still see \"High Seas\" (private property) from Champlain Mountain today. Brunnow named the Orange and Black Path, built in 1913, after the school colors of Princeton University, where he was a Professor of Semitic Philology. The Precipice and Beehive Paths were funded by the Bar Harbor VIA, but Brunnow donated his own funds to the cause. Both trails were immediately popular due to the iron rungs and ladders but others complained that the increased popularity scared off eagles that once nested there.\u00a0<br /> <br /> Brunnow's contributions to the trail system were cut short when he died suddenly from pneumonia in the spring of 1917 but he left behind some of the most challenging, controversial, and highly crafted trails in the Bar Harbor system.\u00a0<br /> <br /> Brunnow was the only son of a German father and American mother. After his first wife died, he and his 5 children moved to New Jersey where he accepted a position as professor of Semitic philology (language studies) in 1908 at Princeton University. He first summered with his children in Bar Harbor in 1909.<br /> <br /> Sources:<br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/acad/learn/historyculture/historic-trails.htm\">Pathmakers</a><br /> Don Lenahan \"<a href=\"https://swhplibrary.net/digitalarchive/items/show/11673\">Rudolph Brunnow and the Myths about Him</a>\"", "geometryPoiId": "", "firstName": "Rudolph", "middleName": "Ernest", "lastName": "Brunnow", "quickFacts": [{"id": "F7A67C96-173F-4675-B374-7E3D3A1818B2", "value": "designer and co-builder of Precipice and Beehive Trails, Bar Harbor Village Association Path Committee chairman 1912-1917", "name": "Significance"}, {"id": "7F812988-263D-4233-81CF-6E7A89621004", "value": "Ann Arbor, MI", "name": "Place of Birth"}, {"id": "5E9CA71F-E57B-4222-BBD3-1A225E2351C2", "value": "1859", "name": "Date of Birth"}, {"id": "3905576C-509A-49F5-A8EE-B4CF14529BBB", "value": "Bar Harbor, ME", "name": "Place of Death"}, {"id": "8F2D2A55-2E87-4DF3-8E09-8520B5A5B7FD", "value": "April 14, 1917", "name": "Date of Death"}, {"id": "E0CEB20D-33EA-4A2E-8444-DE8D7D572CA7", "value": "Princeton, NJ", "name": "Place of Burial"}, {"id": "87BFD41C-3E7B-45DA-9CE0-1AA7C093B2A5", "value": "Princeton Cemetery", "name": "Cemetery Name"}], "credit": ""}
